1
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,117
– Who owns the Infinity Gauntlet?
– Thanos.

2
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:38,227
–What was Thor's father's name?
– Odin. Sorry, Moss, I've really got to go.

3
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:41,037
Awww, just a few more,
just a few more...

4
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:43,437
No, no, I'm sorry, you've done
more than enough.

5
00:00:43,447 --> 00:00:46,657
OK, all right, baby, see you later.
Bye-bye.

6
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:48,247
– Wow!
– Right?

7
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:51,527
That's an impressive knowledge
of the Marvel universe.

8
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:51,957
I know.

9
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,277
Well, you've done it.

10
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,597
You've finally found a woman
I can do business with.

11
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:59,637
Yeah, no, don't say
things like that.

12
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:03,647
– I'm sorry, I'm just so excited for us.
– No...

13
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:11,607
If you don't go in all the way,
it doesn't really count.

14
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,007
Hey, red! Stand back, stand back,
this one's mine.

15
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,437
I'm going to do everything for you,
really nice.

16
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,437
Stand back, stand back,
she's all mine.

17
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:28,447
– It's tight.
– You're so strong.

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,727
It's bubbling over.

19
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:18,047
It's on the house... for you.

20
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:22,567
– Oh, my God!
– You inspire me.

21
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:26,567
– Have a great day.
– I will... and you.

22
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:30,807
– Thank you.
– Ciao.

23
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:38,637
Moss, have you seen the video
of the baby speaking French?

24
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:42,437
It went viral at 10:30, Roy,
of course I've seen it.

25
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,797
I must have been in the toilet.

26
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:47,477
Ah, Jen, exciting news,
I've just uploaded the second

27
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:50,277
episode of my board games
review show.

28
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:54,287
Care to have a look?

29
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:57,197
That was fast.

30
00:02:57,207 --> 00:03:01,207
Seems like only yesterday that we had
to sit through the last one.

31
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,317
It was three months ago, Jen.
Really?

32
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:07,837
It feels like it just happened.
Roy, did you hear that?

33
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:10,587
Moss has done his board game review show again.

34
00:03:10,587 --> 00:03:11,847
I'm not watching that.

35
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,797
I'm not watching that again.

36
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,997
Jesus Christ, we don't have
to watch it, do we?

37
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:19,637
We only sat through the
first one the other day.

38
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:25,647
– It was three months ago.
– My God! Wow, it feels like it just ended.

39
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:33,647
It was so boring! It was like being
insane, it was so insanely boring!

40
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,527
Roy's not a fan
but you said you liked it.

41
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:40,587
– Where did you get your coffee?
– A new place.

42
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,727
– Any good?
– Really good.

43
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,437
You specifically said, and I quote,

44
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,317
– "You must show me the next one, Moss."
– Did I?

45
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,717
Did I really? My God!

46
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,317
Oh, if you'll excuse me,

47
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,957
that'll be my lady love
from the seventh floor.

48
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,077
– That's going well?
– Oh, yeah!

49
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,967
He's cock-a-hoop over this Sheila.

50
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,957
OK, so that'll be over soon, then.

51
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,357
Hey, I'll have you know that Alice
is nuts about me.

52
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:11,367
– She thinks that I'm emotionally artistic.
– Well, what does that mean?

53
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:17,047
Erm, she said that emotionally
I was on the artistic spectrum.

54
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,167
I think it means that I'm creative
about my feelings, you know,

55
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:26,477
more in tune with her wants
and needs than most men.

56
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:29,237
Oh, she's rung out...
That keeps happening.

57
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,957
All right, if I'd said I'd watch it,

58
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,637
then I suppose that's what
I'm going to have to do.

59
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,837
– That's the spirit, Jen.
– Come on, let's get it over with.

60
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,197
Now, keep an open mind.

61
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:41,277
I know the first show was a bit
"bare boned" but I think you'll

62
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:45,157
really enjoy my new episode,
or "webisode", if you prefer.

63
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,037
I don't prefer that, no-one does.

64
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,157
Come on, come on, sooner it starts,
sooner it's over.

65
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:54,167
Game board.

66
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:02,127
Game... game... game...

67
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,317
Game... Board.

68
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,797
Game... Board.

69
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,237
Game... Board.

70
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,247
Board...

71
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:26,287
Hello and welcome to Games Board.
Today on the show, we have...

72
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:31,447
So, guys... I've been playing...

73
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,837
What's coming up on the show...

74
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:39,317
– ..guys?
– I've been playing Ports of Essen.

75
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,997
A strategic trading game,
where each player takes

76
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:47,007
the role of a Danish fishing port
merchant in the 16th century.

77
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,687
And for a change of pace, I've been
looking at the expansion to

78
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:58,847
Textile Merchant, Norfolk Edition.

79
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,477
Two games by Reiner Kiniksi?
Hold on to your hat,

80
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,647
it's going to be a bumpy...

81
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:09,197
Let's talk about components.

82
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:11,957
Shouldn't we do rules
before components?

83
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,797
It won't make any sense
if we do it before the rules.

84
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,277
Don't forget to cut this
conversation.

85
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,687
What? Well,
don't let the actual programme...

86
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:25,847
– How long is this?
– Even hearing it is bad.

87
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,847
I need to stop hearing it.

88
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:31,717
Sorry, Moss, I can't do it, it's
unbearable. Where are you going?

89
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:35,727
– I'm jealous of your coffee.
– You literally can't watch it?

90
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:39,317
I literally can't watch it.

91
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,797
So what can we do to make it better?

92
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:45,477
Well, I don't want to say anything
that might hurt your feelings.

93
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,917
It's all right, I can take it, Jen.
I'm a big boy.

94
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:51,837
Well, as I say, it's slow,
it's so slow.

95
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:55,477
OK, good, it is a bit slow,
we can work on that.

96
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,277
And I guess the other thing is
that it's terrible.

97
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,957
It's slow and terrible.

98
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,317
If a friend asked me to describe it,
I'd say it's a slow,

99
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:07,317
terrible thing on the internet, that
I could only watch for a minute.

100
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,357
Is this helpful?

101
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:16,367
So helpful! God! Slow, terrible,
could only watch it for a minute.

102
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,397
Wow, a lot to get our teeth
stuck into there.

103
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:22,077
OK, well, let's see if I can
help you with anything else.

104
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,797
Erm, none of you are any
good in front of a camera.

105
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:27,557
– None of us, yeah...
– You've got really annoying voices.

106
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,077
The voices are a pain, yes.

107
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:30,837
And I guess that's because you
haven't got any confidence.

108
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:34,387
– No confidence.
– I mean, if there's one thing you need,

109
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,037
it's confidence.

110
00:07:35,047 --> 00:07:37,517
It is confidence. Absolutely.

111
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,397
Well, Jen, I can only thank you,
once again...

112
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:44,407
– And another thing...
– I'm not listening any more!

113
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:52,037
– Douglas, you're encourageable.
– I'm encourageable?

114
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,797
You're Raymond Peterfellow,

115
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,877
owner of the finest lap-dancing
establishments in So-ho,

116
00:07:56,887 --> 00:08:00,887
if anyone's encourageable it's you,
you perfumed porno vampire.

117
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,917
Perfumed porno vampire, I like that.

118
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:10,797
So you're thinking of having 500 of
these travelling across London?

119
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,117
– That's what I said.
– Sexy and classy.

120
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,277
And that's difficult to pull off.

121
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,597
This will get people talking,
all right.

122
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,997
Consider me one happy shareholder.

123
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:24,007
Right. Oh, big party coming up on
Thursday night, if you're up for it?

124
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,277
Damn, I'm supposed to be doing
Secret Millionaire.

125
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:30,997
BLEEP it, I'll cancel.
I'll tell my assistant.

126
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,157
– Hi, Joan.
– Jen. I'm not your  assistant, Mr Reynholm.

127
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,397
I want you to cancel
Secret Millionaire for me.

128
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,677
I'm not your assistant,
wouldn't know who to call.

129
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:41,437
– Just say anything, work your usual magic.
– Not your assistant.

130
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,437
I am not your...

131
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,717
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
this was the toilet.

132
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,197
Didn't this used to be toilets?

133
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:51,207
Yes, I moved my office here to be
closer to the ladies toilets.

134
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:55,557
Must get someone to take
that sign down.

135
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,957
What's wrong with you, Ross?

136
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:01,967
– Small mocha, please.
– Small mocha, please. Okey-dokey.

137
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:07,957
Or medium...

138
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,277
Yeah, you know what? I've changed
my mind, I think I'll have a medium.

139
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:15,287
So, you don't want a small one?

140
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:19,237
Small's fine, small is just as good,
so I'll... just...

141
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:22,957
Yes, that is what I'll have, I'll
have a small mocha, my little man.

142
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:26,967
My good man.

143
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,167
OK, coming up.

144
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:44,847
Got it?

145
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,677
OK.

146
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:57,687
Fuck's sake.

147
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:10,397
Thank you for the virgin
gin and tonic.

148
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:14,407
– I suppose you could just call it tonic.
– Yes.

149
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:18,677
So, Ross, how goes it in
the world of computers?

150
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:21,277
Or PC world, if you will?

151
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,357
We're all very happy,
thank you, Mr Reynholm.

152
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:27,367
Very happy indeed.
– Forget this "we" malarky, I'm talking to you, Ross.

153
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:30,877
– Are you happy?
– Very happy, thank you, Mr Reynholm.

154
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:32,437
Look, I'm not your boss.

155
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,477
We're just a couple of guys,
a couple of guys,

156
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,357
shooting this shit,
now tell me the truth.

157
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:42,367
Well, I suppose, sometimes I do
feel I lack a little confidence.

158
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,757
I know, it's silly.

159
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:49,767
No, I've just realised what
a funny voice you have.

160
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:52,837
Now, Ross, I'm going to
tell you something.

161
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:56,847
Confidence is a confidence trick.
Look at me, what do you see?

162
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:02,117
A man who inherited his father's
successful business.

163
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,757
– Wasn't that successful.
– It was pretty successful.

164
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,997
A lot more successful than it is
now, that's for sure.

165
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,477
All right, all right,
just say the right thing.

166
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,157
Say the thing I want you to say.

167
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:14,917
– Say, "A confident man", say "A confident man".
– A confident man.

168
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:18,077
I wasn't always this way. There was
a time when I was just like you.

169
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:20,877
But then I discovered the secret.

170
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,237
And, Ross, I'm going to tell you
what that secret is

171
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,237
but you must keep it to yourself.

172
00:11:25,247 --> 00:11:29,247
I will take my ears to the grave.

173
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:34,247
Two words. Women's slacks.

174
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,077
I'm sorry?

175
00:11:42,087 --> 00:11:46,087
Women's slacks.

176
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:50,847
– Women's slacks?
– Yes. I'm wearing women's slacks.

177
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:57,047
– You're wearing women's slacks?
– Yes.

178
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:03,587
That's nothing like what I thought
you were going to say.

179
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:04,637
Is it not?

180
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:06,237
It is not.

181
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,367
I thought you were going to give me
a book recommendation, or something.

182
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,077
Book recommendation? I can't read.

183
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,797
No, I don't know what it is,
but women's slacks give me

184
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:20,197
the confidence I need to survive
in a tough business world.

185
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,557
They're lighter, airier and less
constricted than men's trousers

186
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:26,367
and I'm pretty sure it doesn't
make me a transvestite.

187
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:41,007
Look at that shit, look at it.
I can't... How am I supposed to...

188
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:45,127
– It looks like he milked a cow over it.
– You're so fussy about coffee.

189
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:49,207
– It's very annoying.
– It's ruined. He ruined my coffee.

190
00:12:49,207 --> 00:12:51,047
Don't just chuck it like that.

191
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,847
– That fellow shouldn't be allowed to be a barista.
– Why not?

192
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:57,847
Because he's too small, Jen. He's
clearly too small to be a barista.

193
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:03,407
– What?
– You're being a bit of a small person racist, Roy.

194
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,567
A small person racist?
That's not a thing.

195
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,687
You can't have tiny baristas, Jen.

196
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:14,407
For God's sake,
the man works with steam.

197
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,927
I'm going
to have to have a word with him.

198
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,807
– Have a word with him?
– That's right.

199
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,927
About his height?

200
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,767
– I think he'd appreciate the feedback.
– About his height?

201
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,447
That's not what people do, Roy.

202
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:32,167
Well, I'm not people, Jen,
and I think that's a good thing.

203
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,447
I'm not afraid to cut through
the bullshit.

204
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,857
I bet this is exactly what Alison
was talking about.

205
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:38,447
Autistic.

206
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:43,447
She said, "Autistic."
That's what happened.

207
00:13:43,647 --> 00:13:47,647
– No, I don't think so.
– There is no artistic spectrum.

208
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:51,287
But she's so...

209
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:54,727
Did she say it during an argument,
by any chance?

210
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,687
She did say it during a...
She did say it...

211
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:01,207
You know what was weird, was
we were having quite a big argument

212
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,047
and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
she paid me that lovely compliment.

213
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:10,567
Hey, baby.

214
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:14,487
Oh, oh, good, good, yes.

215
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:18,007
Sure, yeah, I'd love to.

216
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:22,007
Yes, OK, well I'll see you there.

217
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,567
What? Why? No.

218
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:29,567
Hello? Alice?

219
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:32,547
– That was weird.
– What?

220
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,727
OK, so, what the hell is that?

221
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:38,687
So she tells me that her grandfather
died, she wants me to go to the

222
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,687
funeral. I say that I'd be
delighted, and then she hangs on me.

223
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:45,087
– Her grandfather's funeral?
– Yeah.

224
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,927
– That's what you were just talking about just there.
– That's right.

225
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:51,927
You sounded like you were being
invited to Glastonbury.

226
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:58,247
– Oh, funerals are sad.
– You did not sound sad.

227
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,567
I wasn't concentrating.

228
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:02,167
Emotionally artistic? You're
emotionally colour-blind,

229
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,687
– ... that's what you are.
– Maybe I am emotional colour-blind.

230
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,047
– I was about to confront that little man.
– I know.

231
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,127
I was going to give him shit about
his height.

232
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:14,127
Glad you realise now how
inappropriate that would've been.

233
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:18,927
I'll just leave him a note.

234
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,007
– I'm here on purpose.
– Oh, yes.

235
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:49,047
– I'm interested in women's slacks.
– I see.

236
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:53,807
I'd like... Sorry. Hot ear.

237
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,527
I'd like to buy a pair
of women's slacks.

238
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,367
For me, not for a woman.

239
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:06,367
Oh, yes,
well, that shouldn't be a problem.

240
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:10,367
– I'm not trying to look like a woman.
– I understand.

241
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,447
I'm not a confident man.

242
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:18,447
Quite. Well, let's see what we can
do for you.

243
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,887
– I don't know about this.
– Oh, just ask them, Jen.

244
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,607
Me and Juan, we have a thing.

245
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:31,447
I don't want another splashy-splashy
coffee from the teeny-tiny coffee man.

246
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,007
Poor woman.

247
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:37,327
No, no, no, don't give her money.
You're not supposed to do that.

248
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:41,327
I'm actually a person,
Roy, with human feelings.

249
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,607
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

250
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:56,047
I don't know what to do.
Here's £5. Do you want £5?

251
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,567
I don't know if you want money. I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

252
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,057
– I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
– What happened?

253
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,167
Never mind, just go.

254
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,937
What do you think?

255
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,367
I think...

256
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,407
you just sold a brother some slacks.

257
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,007
– Help, help, get off me!
– Let go.

258
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,287
You're a bully.

259
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:38,427
Need to save that old woman,
but I have no confidence.

260
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:55,947
Hey!

261
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:04,427
Thank you.

262
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:19,627
Hey, come, come, no queue for you.
Come on.

263
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:24,907
– Hello, Juan.
– I'm with her.

264
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,787
It must be my birthday. I get to see
you twice so quick.

265
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:32,427
Back again. Same as usual, please.

266
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,627
Could I ask you a huge favour

267
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:36,187
and ask you to make Roy's
coffee for him, too?

268
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:40,187
– I've been going on and on about you.
– And I like what I heard.

269
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:42,467
Would that be OK?
Would you mind?

270
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,467
Of course, anything for you, my
sweet. OK.

271
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:56,507
Slippery fingers.

272
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,847
– It's all right.
– It's not all right.

273
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:28,747
Look, it looks like me with a beard.

274
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:33,947
I don't want this. It's horrible.

275
00:19:35,427 --> 00:19:41,367
Oh, my God! I didn't mean to.
I don't hate you.

276
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:42,707
None of this is on purpose.

277
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:48,347
What can I do?
Let me give you some money.

278
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,347
Here's £10. Oh, my God!

279
00:19:53,187 --> 00:19:54,787
I'm not with her.

280
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:58,307
– Oi! Oi! Did you write this comment?
– What? No.

281
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,187
You've got a problem with
smaller people?

282
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:03,987
I don't have a problem with small
people, OK? I don't.

283
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,427
I just don't want you
making my coffee.

284
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:09,827
Because you're bad at it.
You're bad at making coffee.

285
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,307
You're too small. You're too
small to make good coffee.

286
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:16,187
– You know what? Up yours.
– No!

287
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:20,187
Little man, watch out!

288
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:24,547
It's being called
the viral video of the year.

289
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:27,067
A woman throws her coffee
onto a tramp

290
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,347
and then a man has an argument
with a small barista.

291
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:32,707
You're just too small.

292
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:36,707
The barista goes to cross the road
and is hit by a van with breasts.

293
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,627
The woman who's been dubbed by
various online commentators

294
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:45,587
as Coffee Tramp Toss Bitch
has not been identified,

295
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:49,587
while the man known as
Small Person Racist was also...

296
00:20:51,787 --> 00:20:55,787
Small people are not a race.
This isn't Game Of Thrones.

297
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:01,667
They're actually calling me
a bitch on the news.

298
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:04,867
– What the hell happened there?
– How did you find out it was us?

299
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:08,547
It's all here in the weekly
surveillance report.

300
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:11,747
What's going on, Joan?
I expect better from my assistant.

301
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:13,827
I'm not your assistant.
My name isn't Joan.

302
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:17,587
– What's your beef with the homeless?
– I don't have any homeless beef.

303
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:21,587
Ah, so it's women you hate.
Well, that I can understand.

304
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:26,347
Whoa, whoa, you record our
e-mails and tape our phone calls?

305
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:28,587
All right, dry your eyes, Bono.

306
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,427
If you've nothing to hide,
you've nothing to fear.

307
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:34,587
It wasn't my fault Mr Renholm.
I would never throw coffee over

308
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:35,907
a homeless woman.

309
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:38,507
I would never abuse a small person,

310
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:42,507
certainly not enough to make a van
with tits hit him.

311
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:47,667
– Although, I suppose I sort of did.
– I sort of did my one, too.

312
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:51,027
– It's frustrating that we did both of our things.
– Yes, it is.

313
00:21:51,027 --> 00:21:53,067
All right, spare me.

314
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:57,067
I was young once, but if this gets
out, this could deeply damage

315
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:00,827
Renholm Industry's ability to make
that product that we make.

316
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,907
What do you want us
to do, Mr Renholm?

317
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:06,907
Don't do anything. Stay
out of trouble and remain there.

318
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:11,067
There are places lower than
the basement.

319
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:21,787
Stop worrying, Jen. Nobody can
make us out in that video.

320
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:24,507
It's just like early footage of
happy slapping. Just relax.

321
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:27,307
I can't relax. It's all
right for you. I have plans.

322
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:31,417
I want to get up there. I will not
be a social piranha.

323
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,307
A what, now?

324
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,537
– Jim, take a look at this.
– What is it?

325
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:36,907
It's the new-look game board.

326
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:40,907
– 200,000 views?
– I know. It's a bit different.

327
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,347
– Check it out. Game board.
– Shut the fridge. It's...

328
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:50,347
– Game board.
– BLEEP game board.

329
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:57,267
Say what?

330
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:02,347
– Wow! You all seem different somehow.
– Yes.

331
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,947
We're all wearing women's trousers.

332
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:08,347
Oh. Right.

333
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,827
Hey, what's going on? Let's get the
game board.

334
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:13,147
– He is...
– Newton Sinclair.

335
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,467
– This guy is...
– Roger Booth.

336
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,827
And I guess I'm still Maurice Moss.

337
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:22,027
Are you wearing your trousers now?

338
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,747
I couldn't wear them all the time,
Jen - I'd have a heart attack.

339
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:29,747
No, they're safely locked
away in my fortress of solitude.

340
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:33,147
It's funny - when I wear them,
I'm a dynamo.

341
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:36,027
A young Leonard Kravitz,
people hanging off my every word.

342
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:39,547
And then as soon as I take them off,
I'm just back to being the same...

343
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:43,547
– She's gone, hasn't she? She's gone.
– She went quite a while ago.

344
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,417
Yeah.

345
00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:48,427
– Oh, Michael Buble's here.
– No, no, it's a funeral, Moss.

346
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,467
I have to go to this
funeral for Alice's grandfather

347
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,187
and I'm not looking forward to it.

348
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:56,267
Funerals are pain in the crack.

349
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,387
Even in the best of circumstances,
they're no picnic,

350
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:03,387
but now I've got Alice on my arse,
like the emotion police.

351
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:06,827
I'm going to have to look
convincingly sad

352
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:10,827
for the majority of the day.

353
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:13,787
– She's not going to expect me to cry, is she?
– No.

354
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:14,827
What if she does?

355
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,027
I can't cry on cue. What do I do
then?

356
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:22,027
Do what I do when I need to cry.
Use a mild pepper-spray solution.

357
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:25,947
– Now that makes sense.
– See?

358
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,707
That makes more sense than
having to feel something.

359
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:30,467
Do you have any of that stuff here?

360
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:33,067
Why do you think
we have a mini-fridge?

361
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:36,987
Good evening.

362
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:38,547
You've got quite a lot of it.

363
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,707
I suppose I have made
quite a lot of it.

364
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:44,707
– And what's in here?
– Just Tabasco, wasabi and a bit of tear gas.

365
00:24:47,827 --> 00:24:51,707
– Those sound like bad things to put in your eyes.
– It's extremely mild.

366
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:55,707
– It's mainly water.
– OK, I'll take it as a last resort.

367
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:56,337
As a last resort?

368
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:59,147
– In case I find myself out of my emotional death.
– There you go.

369
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:00,047
All right. Thanks, Moss.

370
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:01,147
– Bye.
– Bye.

371
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:08,267
Oh, don't forget to add the water.

372
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,467
Oh, poor Pip Pop.

373
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,787
Sorry, what?

374
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:35,367
Pip Pop...

375
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:39,387
We always called him Pip Pop
because he was so short.

376
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:44,537
All of my family on that side
are really short.

377
00:25:44,537 --> 00:25:45,497
Is that right?

378
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,257
Oh...

379
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,577
Oh, Alice.

380
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:59,577
Shh...

381
00:26:07,057 --> 00:26:07,797
Oh!

382
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,137
– Roy, are you all right?
– Holy...!

383
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:12,377
Yeah, it just really hurts.

384
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:13,897
Oh, darling.

385
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:17,897
– Oh, it hurts.
– I know. I know.

386
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:24,297
Oh...

387
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:32,977
Oh, Christ,
why is this happening?

388
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:37,217
'Will we ever find out
just who this person was?

389
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:40,017
'Unfortunately, with current
technology we can't depixelate

390
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,697
'the picture, so it's very unlikely
we'll ever find out

391
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:46,697
'the identity of
this dreadful ginger cow.'

392
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:54,457
– Oh, are you still crying?
– I don't seem to be able to stop.

393
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:59,737
One of the pallbearers wasn't able
to make it.

394
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:01,497
Look, I know this is a bit weird.

395
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,617
Do you mind stepping in?

396
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:08,457
I'm happy to. I mean, I'm certainly happy to.

397
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:10,657
That's fine.

398
00:27:10,657 --> 00:27:14,297
– Hi, thanks so much for helping us out.
– No problem.

399
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:15,977
Hey!

400
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:18,297
Hello. Oh, there's another one.

401
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:21,577
Hi. Have you seen the
pallbearers? Yeah.

402
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,577
So you guys and me, we are going to
carry the coffin together?

403
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,577
Yes.

404
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:31,457
We are going to put the casket
on our collective shoulders

405
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,177
and walk in a straight line with it?

406
00:27:34,177 --> 00:27:36,577
No, it didn't go well, Jen.
It didn't go well at all.

407
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:39,377
I mean, thanks for asking,
but no, it wasn't a success.

408
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:42,097
It wasn't a successful funeral
for me.

409
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:44,577
It didn't have the required
gravitas.

410
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:47,777
Gravitas? No, no.

411
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:51,777
– It wasn't very dignified.
– It wasn't dignified at all, Jen.

412
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:56,417
If I had to pick a word to describe
Pip Pop's final journey

413
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:00,417
to the grave, it would be "funny".

414
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:04,417
It was so funny, Jen.
Of course, I tried not to laugh

415
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:06,657
and I tried to put
other things in my head,

416
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:09,537
but every step that we took
was a fresh reminder

417
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:13,537
of just how funny
the whole thing was!

418
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:17,577
– You didn't laugh, did you?
– I laughed my hole off.

419
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:21,177
I can't believe
she's still with you.

420
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:23,697
I suppose, but, I mean, I'm hanging
on by a thread, Jen.

421
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:27,537
I think I'll just get through it
as long as nothing else bad happens.

422
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:34,017
There's the phone now.

423
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:40,337
'The new footage has led
to the pair being identified,

424
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:44,337
'Jen Barber and Roy Trenneman, both
employees at Reynholm Industries.'

425
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:45,977
What the hell were you thinking?

426
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,007
I told you to keep a low profile

427
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,137
and you do it again!

428
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:54,617
No, no, no, no, no, it's new
footage, Mr Reynholm.

429
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:56,657
Bum your excuses!

430
00:28:56,657 --> 00:28:59,977
Reynholm Industries has
a reputation to uphold.

431
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:04,007
We're not News International,
for Christ's sake!

432
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:06,217
I'm going to have to do Secret
"Pissing" Millionaire now

433
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:08,097
just to undo your damage!

434
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:11,257
And I'm missing out
on a massive tea party!

435
00:29:12,257 --> 00:29:14,007
You're no longer my assistant.

436
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,177
I'm furious.

437
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:21,337
And I'll tell you something else,

438
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,997
when I return from the estate,
it's...

439
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:25,997
..for you.

440
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:37,637
Hello, hey, baby.

441
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,837
Oh, yeah, of course.

442
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:41,277
No, absolutely.

443
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:45,237
All right, OK. Bye-bye.

444
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:49,237
– She left you?
– She did. Yeah.

445
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:55,107
As the identities
of Coffee Toss Tramp Bitch

446
00:29:55,107 --> 00:29:57,987
and Small Person Racist
are finally revealed,

447
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,787
we at Channel 4 News ask,

448
00:29:59,787 --> 00:30:01,787
"What the hell
is wrong with people?"

449
00:30:10,347 --> 00:30:12,747
I've got a lot of new
followers on Chitter.

450
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:14,347
Loads more followers, yeah.

451
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,907
They're all very abusive.

452
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:17,387
They wish we were dead.

453
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:19,187
Wait.

454
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:21,667
– What?
– Chitter.

455
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:25,667
We can use Chitter
to explain ourselves.

456
00:30:26,147 --> 00:30:27,907
Yeah.

457
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:30,827
Chitter is the perfect place to
explain a complex situation.

458
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,147
I know that.

459
00:30:32,147 --> 00:30:34,427
"I didn't mean to throw
coffee on that woman.

460
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:35,987
"I didn't know she was there.

461
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:38,467
"I went back to try and find her
but..."

462
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:42,347
– Too many characters.
– Too many characters.

463
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,747
Got it.

464
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:45,987
"Hate the homeless.

465
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:49,027
"And I suppose I hate women, too?

466
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,227
"LOL."

467
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:52,387
Send.

468
00:30:52,387 --> 00:30:55,747
– Whoa. You didn't just send that, did you?
– Yes.

469
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,107
That didn't sound so good.

470
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,747
People get the sense of it,
that's the thing about Chitter.

471
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:02,587
It's best if you're conversational
and off-the-cuff.

472
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:04,067
Here it is.

473
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:07,467
Oh... You didn't put a question
mark after the first sentence.

474
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,747
You don't need to
use proper grammar on Chitter.

475
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:12,667
What you've Chitted here, Jen, is,

476
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:16,667
"Hate the homeless and I suppose
I hate women, too. LOL."

477
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:22,467
Phew, I'm glad all that's over.

478
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,987
You're too small,
you're just too small!

479
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:34,827
You're too small...

480
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,827
'Which then leads to him
being hit by a van with tits.'

481
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:51,587
And now Anonymous are after us.

482
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,107
Well, that's just ideal.

483
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:57,427
Oh, a bunch of nerds sitting
at their computer, what can they do?

484
00:32:57,427 --> 00:33:01,427
We pissed off the Internet, Jen.
The Internet is coming to get us!

485
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:06,427
Well, let's get IT
before IT gets us.

486
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:09,867
What are you...?

487
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:12,787
Oh, I don't want Anonymous after me.

488
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,907
I am inanonymous...

489
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,387
I think.

490
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:21,387
Let's hide it.

491
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,107
What?

492
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:25,907
The Internet.

493
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:29,187
Oh...

494
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:33,187
Because we told you
that was the Internet?

495
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:35,427
Yes.

496
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:39,427
We never told you
it wasn't the Internet?

497
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,427
No.

498
00:33:41,427 --> 00:33:44,627
Well, the thing is, Jen...

499
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:47,347
that's not the Internet.

500
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:51,347
What's Jen doing with the Internet?

501
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:55,307
We're not doing that. Oh...

502
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:58,307
Cricket!

503
00:33:58,307 --> 00:34:00,707
Right, don't be scared, yeah.

504
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,587
We're all friends here.

505
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:06,587
– Tell Dougie your story?
– OK, but who is he again?

506
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,947
I'm just your average social worker.

507
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,027
Yes, just in the area
having a look around.

508
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:15,507
Please just pretend I'm not here.

509
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:18,147
Do you ever have anyone come round
and help you and stuff?

510
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,867
Granddad, sometimes.
He's hardly around.

511
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:23,907
– What about your dad?
– He's never around, either...

512
00:34:23,907 --> 00:34:26,907
Sorry, my friend, I need to stop you
there. I must take this.

513
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:28,387
Reynholm...

514
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:31,587
What? Well, increase the bid.

515
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:34,027
I don't care what I said
the ceiling was.

516
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:37,667
I want that artwork by Madonna.

517
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:41,467
Now, 22 million is the minimum
but I'm happy to go to 50.

518
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:45,467
In fact, make 50 the new minimum.
Yes, yes.

519
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:48,267
I can't talk right now.

520
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:52,267
I'm doing Secret Millionaire.

521
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:54,867
That's very sad.

522
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:58,667
Do you want to shut up,
we're filming Secret Millionaire.

523
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,947
Check your privilege.

524
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:03,427
How am I finding it so far?

525
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:06,707
To be honest with you, it's not as
god-awful as I thought it would be.

526
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:10,267
People have been terribly nice.
They're actually quite clean.

527
00:35:10,267 --> 00:35:12,947
I have been invited
to a party this evening.

528
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:16,947
The last party I ever went to was
when Elton John's dog had a baby.

529
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,827
I tell a lie. The last party I went
to was when

530
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,067
Conrad Black got arrested.

531
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,707
Conrad Black, who's that?

532
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:31,787
Oh, no-one, just an old friend.
Let's get in there.

533
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:35,787
Yeah, sure.

534
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:42,707
So I thought with Game Board's
increased viewership,

535
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,067
perhaps it would be a good place
to put my side of the story and

536
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,507
show the world I'm not the monster
I'm currently supposed to be.

537
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:51,627
Boo! Boo!

538
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:52,907
Don't boo, please.

539
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:56,907
That is a horrible T-shirt.

540
00:35:57,107 --> 00:36:00,667
So the question everyone is asking,
Jen Barber, do you hate women?

541
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,587
Oh...

542
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:04,387
Thank you, Jen Barber.

543
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:08,387
Coming up, what was it like to be
a 14th-century grain merchant?

544
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:11,747
– Wait, I don't know if that was clear.
– Sorry, it's these trousers.

545
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:13,677
They make me want to move onto the next item.

546
00:36:13,677 --> 00:36:15,747
It's better broadcasting and the slacks know it!

547
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,367
– Coming up.
– Will you stop saying, "Coming up".

548
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:20,307
– Next...
– I don't know if they got my point!

549
00:36:26,947 --> 00:36:29,467
Richmond, do you work here or not?

550
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:32,867
I don't get paid,
but I like to come in.

551
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:36,307
So that Goth thing didn't work out?

552
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:38,507
Does it look like it worked out?

553
00:36:38,507 --> 00:36:41,147
Anyway, how have you guys been?

554
00:36:41,147 --> 00:36:43,427
Everyone thinks I'm a misogynist.

555
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:46,387
Roy lost his girlfriend because
he's emotionally colour-blind

556
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,707
and Moss is wearing trousers
that make him good at telly.

557
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,587
Any gossip?

558
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:53,867
What's going on with you?

559
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:57,867
Oh, you know, keeping busy,
voice-over work mainly.

560
00:36:58,107 --> 00:36:59,787
Really, how did that happen?

561
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:03,787
Someone just noticed
I had a beautiful voice.

562
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:08,747
Oh, Richmond.

563
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:10,427
Things aren't going well at all.

564
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,707
Just get in there.

565
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:15,107
It's just not the same
when you guys aren't together.

566
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:19,107
Anyway, if you want me,
you know where I am.

567
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,547
I don't, though, Richmond.

568
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:25,227
Don't... lurk!

569
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:26,547
Where did he go?

570
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:30,547
Where did who go?

571
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:36,547
Does it ever seem to you that
the things that happen to us

572
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,587
are sort of...

573
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,267
strange?

574
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,387
How so, Roy?

575
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:44,587
Well...

576
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:47,387
remember when I had to pretend
to be disabled

577
00:37:47,387 --> 00:37:50,547
and I ended up in Manchester?

578
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,267
That wasn't a normal thing
to happen, was it?

579
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:57,267
Or when you ended up spending
the night in that arcade machine.

580
00:37:57,827 --> 00:38:00,627
That was odd.

581
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:03,267
I suppose those were unusual events.

582
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:04,827
And this is strange.

583
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:07,827
What's happening to us
right now is strange, isn't it?

584
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,187
Well, at least,
it'll all be over soon.

585
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:14,187
Douglas is bound to fire us
when he gets back.

586
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,987
Come on, guys, this isn't us.

587
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:17,987
Are we just going to sit here
and take it?

588
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:20,347
What do we normally do
when we get into a scrape?

589
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,747
We normally make things worse
and worse and then it ends.

590
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:25,427
– No, we don't. We stick together.
– That doesn't sound like us.

591
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:28,267
– OK, enough...
– Come on, who are we?

592
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,227
Who are we? I want to hear
you say it!

593
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,987
– We're the IT...
– We're the IT... Department.

594
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,867
You're goddamn right we are!

595
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,267
– Are you wearing women's slacks?
– Yes, I am.

596
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:39,947
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

597
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,227
Let's get into a car
and cruise around.

598
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:59,307
How to get into a car?
Smash a window. Great idea.

599
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,507
That's the one.

600
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,507
I'm such an idiot.
I've got a robot hand.

601
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,307
Hang on a second. This is MY car.

602
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:38,067
Oh, shit. Wow-wow-wow.
It's all right, everyone, be cool.

603
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:41,067
I'll handle this. Take that.

604
00:39:55,347 --> 00:39:59,347
It's all right, Officer, I'm doing
Secret Millionaire.

605
00:40:01,307 --> 00:40:04,587
Come on, people. What's going on?

606
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:05,267
Come on, people.

607
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:09,067
– How long has he been wearing the trousers?
– He won't take them off.

608
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:10,467
OK, come on, ...

609
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:13,307
– What's going on, what's going on?
– We don't know what's happening.

610
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,587
OK, come on. To every problem,
there's a solution.

611
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,627
What's our problem here?
What's our problem?

612
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:21,627
– Everyone thinks I'm a cow who hates women.
– You're a cow.

613
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:26,907
Terrible cow. Women, OK.
Roy, hurt me.

614
00:40:27,187 --> 00:40:29,947
Erm, the woman I love thinks that
I hate small people.

615
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:32,347
Small people, thank you, Roy.

616
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,547
I'm probably going to die alone
in front of computer pornography?

617
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:39,547
I'll just draw a sad face.

618
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:46,667
OK, so what do women and
small people both like?

619
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:49,897
What do they both like?

620
00:40:49,897 --> 00:40:52,347
– Chairs.
– Films.

621
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:53,897
I really don't know.

622
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:57,867
I'll tell you.
– It's just they seem like very different groups.

623
00:40:57,867 --> 00:41:01,867
– Very different groups.
– Not being attacked.

624
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:09,187
They both love not being attacked.

625
00:41:09,187 --> 00:41:13,187
Well, I can't speak for small people,
obviously, but as a woman,

626
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:17,067
– I certainly like not being attacked.
– Where are you going with this, Moss?

627
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,387
I'll tell you exactly where I'm
going with this, Roy.

628
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:22,427
I'm saying that we use this brief
window, while Douglas is away,

629
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:26,267
to produce a pepper-spray
solution for small women,

630
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,427
using that stuff I gave Roy earlier.

631
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:29,947
That sounds really weird.

632
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:33,947
Jen Barber, not a hater of women
but their defender, their champion.

633
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,547
I love it now.

634
00:41:36,547 --> 00:41:39,227
And I can do a massive presentation.

635
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:43,227
A self-defence pepper spray for
small women suits my purposes also.

636
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:48,667
It will show Alice that I care and,
as a woman with small relatives,

637
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,947
she's sure to come to Jen's
presentation.

638
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:55,307
You know, when I first stocked that
mini-fridge with pepper-spray solution,

639
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:59,307
I thought I'd made too much... but
only now do I realise

640
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:04,587
that I'd made exactly the right
amount for our current purposes.

641
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:09,947
It almost seems like it's
too good an idea.

642
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:13,947
You see what we can do when we work
together? With my business acumen...

643
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:17,987
– My scientific know-how...
– And I'm also here...

644
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:23,547
– We can do anything!
– Yes!

645
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:27,907
I need a trouser break.

646
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:36,387
You coming, Roy?

647
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,027
I can't seem to get the wording
of this speech to Alice right.

648
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,427
You're doing a speech?

649
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,507
Yeah, I need to show her that I'm
not emotionally colour-blind.

650
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:47,507
I'm actually a very sensitive human
man, and she needs to know that.

651
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:51,587
Oooh, what's a more romantic word
for "knockers"?

652
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,627
A MORE romantic word?

653
00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:57,877
– Come on, guys. Let's protect women!
– I'll meet you up there.

654
00:42:57,877 --> 00:42:58,587
Good luck.

655
00:42:58,587 --> 00:42:59,227
Thanks.

656
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:04,387
Eartha Kitts!

657
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:06,187
Right, is everything ready?

658
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:07,787
Yeah, well, I've got the posters up

659
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,667
and I've put gift bags with pepper
spray beside each chair.

660
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,307
Now, I think it was a master stroke
to put the spray in these

661
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:14,667
elegant bottles.

662
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,627
Why not look stylish
while you defend yourself?

663
00:43:17,627 --> 00:43:19,667
Something's bothering me, though.

664
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:23,427
Are we missing something that's very
obviously wrong with this idea?

665
00:43:23,427 --> 00:43:26,427
I really don't think so. Oh, look,
here comes everyone.

666
00:43:30,147 --> 00:43:34,147
Hello, and welcome to this
very special

667
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:38,147
presentation for women by a woman, me
a woman, who loves women.

668
00:43:38,947 --> 00:43:42,667
By your seats you'll find a gift bag,
and in that gift bag

669
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:45,107
you'll find our very
exciting new product.

670
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:47,467
No, don't do that.

671
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:53,067
No, you're not supposed to...

672
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:56,467
Yes! I have some things
I have to say to you!

673
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,867
– No, I need to go.
– No, you are going nowhere.

674
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:03,867
Now, I know in the past that you
have accused me

675
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:06,147
of being emotionally colour-blind.

676
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:11,307
Shut up and listen. But now I've
changed - my sight is perfect.

677
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:14,427
Now I know what was wrong
with the idea.

678
00:44:14,427 --> 00:44:18,427
With your sweet lips and, of
course, your lovely bangers,

679
00:44:19,347 --> 00:44:21,547
I know you're the one for me.

680
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:24,067
I'm in terrible pain.

681
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:28,067
Me, too, Alice, me, too, but that
ends now. It ends now.

682
00:44:35,747 --> 00:44:38,387
That could not have gone better.

683
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:41,747
Oh, no, Roy, that didn't go
well at all.

684
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:45,747
Oh, right, because we're going to
lose our jobs.

685
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:48,907
Argh!

686
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,107
Mr Reynholm...

687
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:53,547
So, that's the thing. I gave the boy
the can of lager,

688
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:56,227
so technically I'm guilty of
corrupting a minor.

689
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,587
So it's the reason why
I bought the tramp uniform

690
00:44:58,587 --> 00:45:01,627
and I've had to make myself scarce.

691
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:05,547
– So, you need somewhere to hide out?
– Yeah, somewhere off-piste.

692
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:08,787
– Somewhere where no-one will find you.
– Bottom of the world.

693
00:45:08,787 --> 00:45:11,507
You can use our office if you'd like.

694
00:45:11,507 --> 00:45:14,107
Well, I'll need someone to take
care of business upstairs.

695
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:15,547
We're not doing anything.

696
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,267
Well, this is perfect.

697
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:21,267
My wonderful assistant, Joan,
and her two friends, Ross.

698
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:24,467
I'm going to go and piss around
on the internet

699
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:27,067
but actually I'll need some food.

700
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:31,067
I've already eaten one of
the toys in here.

701
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:35,867
– Did he just say what I think he said?
– I wasn't really listening.

702
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:41,347
Is this... Is what's happening good
now? Is this good?

703
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:45,107
Yes, it's a very good outcome.
Oh, my God!

704
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:47,147
I think we've come out on top,
I can't believe it.

705
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:49,067
We've come out on top.

706
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:50,827
'Jen Barber.'

707
00:45:50,827 --> 00:45:54,147
– Oh, I forgot about you.
– Oh, God, that's impressive.

708
00:45:54,147 --> 00:45:58,147
They're actually watching us.
Hey, mate, am I an anonymous?

709
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:01,907
Silence, you person wasters.

710
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:04,627
Greetings, Jen Barber.
This is your sentence.

711
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:08,507
You've been found guilty of the most
appalling lack of basic human

712
00:46:08,507 --> 00:46:09,987
kindness and decency.

713
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:13,507
Come in.

714
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:14,287
Shush, you.

715
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:17,507
– Peter, what are you doing in there?
– Shut up!

716
00:46:18,387 --> 00:46:21,667
– You've been there for hours.
– I'm doing something. Go away!

717
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:25,667
– Peter, your mum and I are worried about you.
– Get out.

718
00:46:26,227 --> 00:46:30,227
You need to get off this computer.
Who is this? Are these your friends?

719
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:34,467
I'm sorry. Peter can't play any
more. He's coming outside.

720
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:37,227
'You said I could stay
here as long as I wanted.'

721
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,027
We said that you had to come out.

722
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,387
'..do my homework...

723
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:49,387
'I've done my homework...

724
00:46:49,827 --> 00:46:51,827
'I know my rights...'

725
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:58,667
This internet's not working.
I can't connect.

726
00:46:58,667 --> 00:47:01,427
Just try turning it off
and on again.

727
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:05,427
Thanks, Ross.

728
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,747
Reynholm Industries is changing.

729
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:30,747
New opportunities, new faces,
a new direction.

730
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:33,587
A better workplace environment.

731
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:37,587
Exciting new products.

732
00:47:38,107 --> 00:47:41,867
An inclusive hiring policy...
I am sounding happy?

733
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:45,107
– Can you be a little bit more...
– Yeah, this is me being happy.

734
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:48,267
– Just be a bit more, I don't know...
– I'm being upbeat.

735
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:51,347
No, I just want you to speak...
Ah, forget it, let's just stop.
