1
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,737
Come on, settle. The
sooner you're settled,

2
00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:35,617
the sooner this is over with.

3
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,857
Thank you. Now, you're going to meet

4
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:41,857
some men today who've taken
a wrong turn in their lives

5
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:45,487
and they're going to tell you
their stories and hopefully

6
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:49,167
make you think a little bit
about the roads you're going down.

7
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,087
It's not going to be any kind of fun,

8
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,327
so you can wipe those
smiles off your faces.

9
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:57,327
Right, let's meet our first speaker.

10
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,367
What the flip are you looking at?

11
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:10,647
You think this is funny?

12
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:13,487
You think this is some kind
of mother flipping joke?

13
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:17,237
Mother flippers think everything's
a mother flipping joke.

14
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:21,237
Well, let me tell you, the
jokey ain't no jokey, sucker.

15
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:24,757
Look at me and what do you see?

16
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:28,757
Just a bad ass brother who
made a mistake. One mistake.

17
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,357
And now I'm staring at you gimps.

18
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,117
Every flippin' day!

19
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:37,277
So what's my story?

20
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:39,997
How did a brother get here?

21
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:41,717
Well, I'll tell you.

22
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:45,717
It all started when I went to
fix a printer on floor seven.

23
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:50,027
As I recall, it was a Tuesday.

24
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:52,827
It's a lot faster now,

25
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:55,907
it's one of the advantages
of the Pentium processor.

26
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,167
Yeah...

27
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,747
I like your glasses.

28
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:03,187
I'm afraid they're not for sale.

29
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,827
Ha ha.

30
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:07,627
Laugh all you want,
they're not for sale.

31
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,227
You're funny.

32
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:11,987
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki!

33
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:15,227
What are you talking
to Clive Sinclair for?

34
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:16,347
Shut up, Rodge.

35
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:18,457
Good one. Yup. I get it.

36
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,297
You obviously don't, mate.

37
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,007
Come on, back in your box.

38
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,377
Nice tie, by the way!

39
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:29,337
Thank you.

40
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:31,097
Roy, can you come here, please?

41
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:34,297
Just hold on a second, Jen.
I'm giving phone support.

42
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:35,617
Okay, so how did that go?

43
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:39,457
Well, yeah, but that's an
important part of the process.

44
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:41,177
Yes, if you don't complete that part,

45
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,737
there's no way you're going
to be able to do the next bit.

46
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:47,737
Okay, so now... Turn it back on again!

47
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,727
People!

48
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,807
That is rude! What is that?

49
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,567
Oh, Jen, I have to say, "Have you
tried turning it off and on again?"

50
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,447
1,000 times a day. It's
like a bloody catchphrase.

51
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:02,167
If it wasn't for you and Moss
it would be the only thing I say.

52
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,207
It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:05,927
Don't take your bad career
decisions out on the users.

54
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:07,167
I'm not saying it again today.

55
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,967
They can just figure
it out for themselves.

56
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,167
You'll never go a whole
day without saying it.

57
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,567
You don't think I can?

58
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,607
No way.

59
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,847
I bet you 1,000 I can.

60
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,967
That's just posturing. 1,000.

61
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,557
All right. Okay. 100 says
I don't say it again today.

62
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,877
How's that for posturing?

63
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:25,677
All right, you're on. 100 quid.

64
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:26,517
All right.

65
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,557
Can you come here for a sec, please?

66
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:30,877
I want you to take a look at something.

67
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,557
Can't I do it on the phone?

68
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:36,557
Just come in! It's like 20 feet!

69
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,717
You all right, Moss?

70
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,397
I don't mind telling you, Roy,

71
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,957
that sometimes the people upstairs
cheese me off to such an extent

72
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,197
that if I were the type
to use bad language,

73
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:51,907
I'd be employing it
bitterly and repeatedly!

74
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,227
Whoa. Moss, that's not like you.

75
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:56,627
Well, I'm sorry for
mentioning bad language.

76
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:00,627
No, use bad language, Moss,
please. It'll make you feel better.

77
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:10,987
Ploppers!

78
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:14,187
Someone told me I need
a browser on my computer.

79
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,867
Could you install one please?

80
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,787
You don't have a browser
on your computer...?

81
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,187
What is that sound? Is that
coming from your laptop?

82
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:25,177
It's not supposed to sound...
What the...?! What's all that crap?

83
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:29,017
Look at all this stuff! I haven't
seen that one since the '90s!

84
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,337
Jen, I have to fix this.

85
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,897
No, no, leave it! I
have it how I like it!

86
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,857
How you like it?! No, no,
no, Jen, it's infected!

87
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:39,857
If this was a human being,
I'd shoot it in the face!

88
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:42,697
I just want you to install a browser.

89
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:43,937
That's the browser there!

90
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,937
Look at it... that's the browser.
Internet Explorer is a browser!

91
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,897
Behind the picture of the lady.
The lady's not supposed to be there.

92
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:53,887
She's only there sometimes.
But what about that, the E...

93
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:56,407
But that's the button for
the internet, Roy. I don't...

94
00:04:56,417 --> 00:05:00,407
The button for the
internet?! Jesus Christ!

95
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:03,367
Oh, shut up! I'm not
a stupid geeky geek.

96
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,847
Jen, you don't need to be a geek

97
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,447
to know that you need a
browser to access the internet!

98
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:10,247
Yes, because as soon as you
know something like that,

99
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:13,327
it pushes out something
important and before you know it,

100
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:16,407
you're painting little
figurines from Lord of The Rings.

101
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,127
You know what, Jen? Do
whatever you want. I don't care.

102
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:21,567
You want to walk around with
a laptop from The Exorcist,

103
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,047
that's fine. It's not my problem.

104
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:27,037
Our time is too valuable!

105
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,957
Come on, Moss, let's
go. It's nearly one.

106
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:33,357
Oh, don't forget. They're giving
a party for Ben Genderson at lunch.

107
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:35,317
Ben Genderson? How nice for him.

108
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:38,157
He's been here, what?
A week? When's our party?

109
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:39,517
I thought you hated parties.

110
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:41,997
I like parties.
It's balloons I don't like.

111
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:42,957
Right.

112
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,437
You don't like balloons?

113
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,317
Oh, don't talk to me about balloons.

114
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:47,277
Why?

115
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,637
Why? Balloons explode, Jen.

116
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,957
They explode suddenly and unexpectedly.

117
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:54,157
They are filled with the capacity
to give me a little fright

118
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,987
and I find that unbearable.

119
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,547
Where do you want to go for lunch?

120
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,947
It's such a lovely day,
shall we go to the park?

121
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:03,947
Yeah, let's have a
lovely lunch in the park.

122
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:21,787
Roy, do you think if I hadn't
paid so much attention in school

123
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,307
I'd be a different person?

124
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:27,297
No.

125
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:34,977
We're going to be late
for Ben Genderson's party.

126
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,777
So? I don't want to go to that
thing. If we go to that party,

127
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:40,497
do you know how many times I'm going to have
to say, "Have you..." The thing that I say?

128
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:43,137
We've got to hurry up,
we're going to be in trouble.

129
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,177
I'm not running.

130
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,217
Can you do a fast walk?

131
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,257
No.

132
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:51,257
I'm going to do a fast
walk. See you there.

133
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,567
I need to be at work.

134
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:05,447
Sorry, sir. Whole street's
closed. Suspicious package.

135
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,407
Come on, let's go the long way round.

136
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,647
We'll miss the presentation. We're
already late. We'll get in trouble.

137
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:11,927
Calm down.

138
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,327
I can't, Roy. What are we going to do?

139
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:15,647
Moss, it doesn't matter.

140
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,647
We're going to get in trouble.

141
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,047
You're not going to get in trouble.

142
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,447
Getting in trouble is something
that happens to children.

143
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:26,287
You're a grown man. Come on.

144
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:30,277
Why don't we bunk off?

145
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,917
What?!

146
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,797
I was hoping to avoid Jen today
anyway. Why don't we just...

147
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,397
We'll bunk off and make a
day of it. It'll be a laugh.

148
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:42,077
Oh, gosh, I've got to take this in.
I've never bunked off in my life!

149
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:44,237
What... what... what will
we do? Where will we go?

150
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:46,437
You know, we'll do
bunking off kind of things.

151
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:49,357
Should we be talking this close to
the police? I mean, it is illegal...

152
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,797
Not unless you're supposed to
be in school! Will you relax?

153
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:54,477
I'm excited, Roy. This is like
taking the blue pill in the Matrix.

154
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:57,477
I mean, bunking off. The old
me would never have done that!

155
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,477
Say goodbye to that guy. That
guy's history! BANG! He's gone!

156
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:03,467
Could you not say "bang!"
There's a bloody bomb somewhere!

157
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:07,907
Come on, let's just go.

158
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:11,907
Would you stop looking so suspicious!

159
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,307
Which is why after one week
with us, we honour Ben Genderson.

160
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,427
Come on, Ben, say a few words.

161
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,507
I don't know what to...

162
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,227
Such a lovely thing to happen.

163
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,657
I never thought that a major corporation

164
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:36,737
would be able to focus on
one individual like this.

165
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:39,617
At my last company,
I felt rather insignificant,

166
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,777
so it's appreciated, it really is.

167
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,697
Cheers.

168
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:48,697
Don't raise your glass too soon, Ben,
cos this has all been one big ruse.

169
00:08:49,257 --> 00:08:51,777
It isn't your day at all.

170
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:00,857
That's right. I thought it high time

171
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:04,087
to give the IT Department
the attention they deserve.

172
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:06,327
Where are Mark and Ray?

173
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,047
They're not back from lunch yet.

174
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:14,047
Really? I flew George Lucas
in to see them as a treat.

175
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,807
Oh, well, Jen, more champagne for us.

176
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,927
Let the revels begin!

177
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:36,077
Oh, yes.

178
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,137
Sitting on the bus.

179
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:46,257
On the open road.

180
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:48,937
Kicking back.

181
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:52,297
Just a pair of cheeky bunkers.

182
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:54,457
Couple of ne', er do wells.

183
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:57,097
Yeah.

184
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,097
Roy, can I clarify something?
Are we now loitering?

185
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,057
Erm... yeah.

186
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:05,207
Because it feels like travelling.

187
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:08,127
Sure, but we don't want to
go where this bus is going.

188
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:09,927
So there's an element of loitering.

189
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:10,927
There's an aimlessness.

190
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,007
Exactly.

191
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:15,847
Yeah! Who'd want to end up
going to where they wanted to be?

192
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,327
That's what the man wants.

193
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,447
Sock it to 'em.

194
00:10:18,447 --> 00:10:22,447
Fools!

195
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:29,247
Roy, let's glare.

196
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,287
What?

197
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:34,277
Let's glare at people,
like a couple of tough nuts.

198
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,557
Okay! Who?

199
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:40,277
Let's glare at this
sucker on his way to work.

200
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:44,277
Feeding the corporate machine.

201
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:45,397
He's coming up.

202
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:48,037
He's coming up. He's getting
on the bus! Oh, no.

203
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:52,037
Why did you suggest him?
You could've suggested anybody.

204
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:54,117
What are you looking at?

205
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:56,957
We weren't. We thought
you were someone else.

206
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,837
What's it to you?

207
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,757
I'm sorry. We're bunking
off, and he's excited.

208
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:05,747
We're bunking off!

209
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:09,027
Roy has a fear of balloons.

210
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,427
A fear of balloons!

211
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:16,467
That's the craziest thing
I've ever bloody heard!

212
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,547
Some wine for you.

213
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:18,947
Sorry, I asked for red.

214
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:19,587
Oh, sorry.

215
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:22,827
No, no, no, leave it.

216
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,507
Thishasbeen a success.

217
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:27,267
I have had a lovely, lovely time.

218
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:29,227
As thingy was saying earlier,

219
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,377
it's easy to go unrecognised
in a big corporation,

220
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:35,777
so it's appreciated,
it really is. Cheers.

221
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:39,777
Don't raise yourglasses too soon,
cos this ruse has also been a ruse.

222
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:46,497
Ladies and gentlemen,

223
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:50,497
let meintroduce to you our new head
ofhiring and firing, Ben Genderson.

224
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:58,137
So, Ben, you've been circulating
throughout this fake party,

225
00:11:58,137 --> 00:11:59,657
coming to conclusions.

226
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,017
Who's the obvious dead wood?

227
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:04,847
Well, yes. Well,
there's Paul over there,

228
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,287
he's been putting his
shopping on expenses.

229
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,407
James here, he can't spell,

230
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,607
and... Sorry, what's your name?

231
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,647
Jeremy.

232
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:16,847
Jeremy, yes. Jeremy's a drunk.

233
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:20,847
And Jen. Jen lacks
basic computer skills,

234
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:25,007
like thinking that IT
stands for "internet things".

235
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Yeah. I don't really need
to know about those things.

236
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,877
I'm a relationship manager.
I manage my team, I'm a team leader.

237
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:36,877
And where's your team now?

238
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,917
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

239
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:43,917
Is this my party or not?

240
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:51,917
What are we doing?

241
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,367
We are loitering.

242
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,797
We are shopping.

243
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:01,277
We don't have any money,
so it's definitely loitering.

244
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:05,267
Mark my words, in half an hour,
we shall be asked to leave.

245
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:11,507
Oh, It's Jen.

246
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:12,907
Hello, Jen!

247
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:14,387
Where are you?

248
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:18,387
We're just sort of taking
a long lunch sort of thing.

249
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:22,627
You can't! I've been sent an e-mail
questionnaire, have to do it  today!

250
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,067
I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,827
It wasn't Ben Genderson's thing,

252
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:28,427
it was our thing. And then
it was some scary thing,

253
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,947
and now he's sent me a
questionnaire about my job

254
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,387
and my computer won't work!

255
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:36,297
Is that the best you can
do? I'm not going to say it!

256
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:38,977
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

257
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:42,977
Goddammit, Roy! I didn't bunk off
so I could do some flipping perusing!

258
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,097
I want a taste of the apple, Roy!

259
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:48,857
I want to bite the
electric tiger's tail,

260
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:52,217
and ride it till the end
of the mother flipping line.

261
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,777
Will you just calm down, Moss?

262
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:06,567
What are you doing?

263
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:07,767
I'm shoplifting!

264
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,407
You've just gone insane!

265
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,327
I've never felt so alive!

266
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:13,647
We need to get this stuff back!

267
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,367
Okay, they're on to us. Let's just go.

268
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:20,367
Erm, act normal.

269
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,007
What is wrong with you? Who are you?

270
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:30,007
I don't know any more!

271
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,107
What are we going to do?

272
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,757
No, that's not going to work!

273
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:45,797
Okay, run! Run, run, run!

274
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:54,117
Come on! Come on!

275
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:09,587
Hello. Do you wish for
technical assistance?

276
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,027
Oh, God, I hate these!

277
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:14,067
Sorry?

278
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,347
What?

279
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,507
How dare you speak to me like that?

280
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:22,507
Sorry. Can I have technical
assistance, please?

281
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:27,507
Putting you through. Cow.

282
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,067
Allo?

283
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,347
Hello?

284
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,417
Allo. How can I be of assistance?

285
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:35,617
What?

286
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:38,337
How can I be of assistance?

287
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:42,337
I've got one of your laptops. It
won't get past the loading screen.

288
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:45,537
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

289
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,377
Yes. Look, is there
someone else I can talk to?

290
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:50,057
There is no-one else available.

291
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:51,137
All right, all right.

292
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,177
All right, all right.
What model do you have?

293
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:55,057
What model do I have?

294
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,017
Yes.

295
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,897
It's a Zubion, I think.

296
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,967
Ah, the Zubion. I have to say,
we have been having problems

297
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:04,007
with the Zubion. Can you
press delete while starting up?

298
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:05,847
I didn't get that.

299
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:09,847
Can you press delete while starting up?

300
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,967
No. That was worse somehow.

301
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,847
Okay. Can...

302
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,687
Can?

303
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,807
Yes. Can you press...

304
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,207
Can you press.

305
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:19,047
Delete.

306
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,487
Delete. Delete. Can I press delete?

307
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:21,687
While.

308
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:23,407
Wheel?

309
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,367
While.

310
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:26,527
Whhhheeeel?

311
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,367
While. Er...during!

312
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,327
While! While.

313
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:32,557
Yes, while!

314
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:33,237
Yes.

315
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:35,757
Starting.

316
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:39,757
Allo?

317
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:45,197
Come on, Roy! Come
on! We're nearly there!

318
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,037
It's no use.

319
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:51,037
I can't. I can't.
We're going down again!

320
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,517
How many times is that now?

321
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:56,677
Oh, this is ridiculous! I
don't want to do this any more!

322
00:16:56,677 --> 00:17:00,667
Oh, all right. All right.

323
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,347
What was all that about?

324
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,907
What?

325
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:07,907
You shouldn't be messing
around on those things. Go on.

326
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:13,187
Don't come back here.
I know your faces now!

327
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,427
Bunking off was a terrible idea.

328
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,707
I mean, you were
completely out of control.

329
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,467
Do you even like Grand Designs?

330
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,867
Yuh!

331
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:32,017
You'll send those DVDs back to the shop.

332
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,537
Okay. I'm sorry, Roy.

333
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:36,137
It's okay. Okay, let's just
try and get back in to work,

334
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:39,537
and hopefully nobody will
have noticed we were away.

335
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:42,017
Oh, my gosh!

336
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:49,337
It's a robot!

337
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:51,617
I've never seen one in the wild before.

338
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:54,697
Where've you come from, fella?
Huh? Where do you come from?

339
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:57,897
Can we keep him, Roy? I mean,
if he doesn't belong to anyone?

340
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,087
I just don't understand what it's doing.

341
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:04,087
I mean, this is weird. What is it?

342
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,367
Erm... Moss?

343
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:18,647
What?

344
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,967
Get away from it.

345
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,527
Why?

346
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:27,367
Hello, Jen!

347
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,767
It's a robot!

348
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,357
Get away!

349
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:32,037
What?

350
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:36,037
Get away! Get away
from it. There's a bomb!

351
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,157
What are you saying?

352
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:42,157
There's a bomb in the bag!

353
00:18:44,997 --> 00:18:48,997
I think this might be
a bomb disposal robot, Roy.

354
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:51,077
I know.

355
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:53,037
We should move away from it.

356
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:57,037
Yes. We should. But I don't
seem to be able to move.

357
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:58,677
What?

358
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,077
I can't move.

359
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,267
What do you mean, you can't move?

360
00:19:01,277 --> 00:19:04,747
What do you mean, you
can't move? I can't move.

361
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,547
You have to move, Roy.

362
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,067
I can't move!

363
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:13,387
I'm just having a couple
of problems with it.

364
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,787
What kind of operating
system does it use?

365
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,747
It's... Vista!

366
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,807
We're going to die!

367
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:26,007
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

368
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:26,827
What?

369
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:30,307
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

370
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:31,657
What?

371
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:36,417
Have you tried turning
it off and on again?

372
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:39,507
I just won 100 quid.

373
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,457
Okay. Hang on a second.

374
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,737
Why are you still here?
Why haven't you run away?

375
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:46,417
Come on, we're a team, I could...

376
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:50,417
Wait, I could totally
run away, couldn't I?

377
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,297
It's still not working!

378
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:04,207
Oh, this is a very
common problem with Vista.

379
00:20:04,207 --> 00:20:06,287
I can fix this. I can fix this, Roy!

380
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,247
Everything's going to be okay.

381
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:13,527
Right. Come here, you.

382
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,727
Wait for me!

383
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,007
Is there a customer support number?

384
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:34,157
Allo! How can I be of assistance?

385
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,407
What?

386
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,397
So, that's my story.

387
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:44,877
It ain't a pretty story,
but it's the only one I've got.

388
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,877
And if you bozos don't
buckle up and fly right,

389
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:51,877
it'll be your story too, capice?

390
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:19,467
You say you've been having problems

391
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:22,227
with this particular
bomb disposal computer?

392
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:23,267
What?

393
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:24,587
You must take good care,

394
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:28,577
as the slightest movement can
initiate the detonator procedure.

395
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:32,257
Seems to me like the domain
link is incapacitated,

396
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,257
so perhaps you could try
turning off the robot,

397
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,577
and then get the man
to run away quickly?
