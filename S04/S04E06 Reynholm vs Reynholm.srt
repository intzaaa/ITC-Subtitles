1
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:34,547
And every other day, I
take a short helicopter ride

2
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:36,127
to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant.

3
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:37,647
Last night,

4
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,967
I ate a chocolate radio that
still worked in my stomach,

5
00:00:41,187 --> 00:00:44,267
and a flat chicken that was
actually a glass of water.

6
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:46,107
Even the menu was edible.

7
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,947
They said it wasn't, but I ate it.

8
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,527
Sounds like you're
living the life of Riley.

9
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:55,047
Well, I actually knew Riley,
and yes, there are similarities.

10
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:59,947
And yet, there is some sadness in
your life. Tell me about Victoria.

11
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:03,187
You'll have to forgive me,
there's been quite a few Victorias.

12
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:04,507
Your wife?

13
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:08,377
My God, my wife. Yes, Victoria!

14
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:12,377
What a fantastic woman. The two weeks
we were married were unforgettable.

15
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:17,527
She disappeared in mysterious
circumstances, did she not?

16
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:20,207
She vanished while washing the car.

17
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,987
Despite a search that lasted
nearly five hours, we found nothing.

18
00:01:24,307 --> 00:01:27,967
– So naturally, we assumed the worst.
– You must miss her.

19
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:30,627
More than words could say.

20
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:36,827
I'd give anything to see her
walk through that door right now.

21
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:44,387
Hey, why don't you
take your clothes off?

22
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:45,887
What?

23
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:49,827
Come on, we both knew it was on the cards
as soon as I realised you were a woman!

24
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,587
What if someone were to walk in?

25
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:55,687
I left strict instructions not to
be disturbed in case we had sex.

26
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:58,867
There's no way anyone is
walking through that door...

27
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:00,707
Hello, Douglas.

28
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,067
Victoria!

29
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,527
But I thought you were dead!

30
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,607
I must say, Douglas, you still
don't seem very pleased to see me.

31
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:20,047
No, no, I must have eaten
some bad stereo system.

32
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:23,347
– How's the wine?
– Exquisite.

33
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:24,827
From the chef's own cellar.

34
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:30,057
What are you doing, Victoria?
Last time I saw you, you were...

35
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,747
Washing the car? Yes,
I imagine you have many questions.

36
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,857
I was under a lot of stress
that day, Douglas. I think we both were.

37
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,457
We both knew it wasn't working.

38
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:41,577
I picked up my sponge
and bucket with a heavy heart that day.

39
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:44,647
The rest is a blank.The next thing
I can remember with any clarity

40
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,907
is being on a kayaking
holiday two years later.

41
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,907
That looks good! What's that?

42
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,287
I sort of wish I'd ordered that.

43
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,287
Our invisible desserts have arrived!

44
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:58,147
I know we weren't happy that second
week of our marriage, Douglas,

45
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,507
but give us another chance, as a couple.

46
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,887
I don't know.

47
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:06,487
I don't think we can just
pick up from where we left off.

48
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,727
No, Victoria, I'm sorry, it's over.

49
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:14,547
Oh God!

50
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,087
I forgot you could do that.

51
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,007
Maybe we should give it another go!

52
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:28,907
Well that is new!

53
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:31,467
How are you doing that?

54
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:33,007
That might be the dog.

55
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,707
Heston!

56
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,487
I'd like to introduce you to my...

57
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,847
Wife...

58
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,267
I want to divorce my wife.

59
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,087
Why are you telling me?

60
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:52,627
Aren't you with legal?

61
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,247
No.

62
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:56,047
Remind me?

63
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:58,727
IT. Relationship manager.

64
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,227
Well then I probably shouldn't
have told you any of that.

65
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:03,907
Anyway...

66
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,227
I want to divorce her right now.

67
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:08,687
Now's too late. Before now.

68
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,827
In fact, I want to have already
divorced her, is that possible?

69
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,367
Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer, so...

70
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,287
Yes, but you're a relationship
manager, and this is a relationship!

71
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:20,787
Well...

72
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:22,547
Have you told her yet?

73
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:27,207
Kind of. I changed my
Friendface profile from «married»

74
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,547
to «it's complicated».

75
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:32,627
That's not the same as
telling her, Mr. Reynholm.

76
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,547
Yeah, but someone will
pass it on. Why not you?

77
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,427
No!

78
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,157
Come on! Please break up with

79
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,767
my vanishing, car cleaning
wife! I don't want to do it!

80
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,307
I don't want to do it!

81
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,987
I'll give you... I don't know...

82
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,427
10 thousand pounds.

83
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,447
Who are you again?

84
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,227
I'm Jen Barber.

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,367
I'm with the IT department
at Reynholm Industries.

86
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,647
Sorry, I thought
I was meeting my husband.

87
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:04,447
Mr. Reynholm asked me to
convey a message to you.

88
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:16,607
Mrs. Reynholm.

89
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,327
How long have you
and Mr. Reynholm known each other?

90
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,407
About ten years.

91
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:22,787
Ten years, ten wonderful years.

92
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:24,787
Who are you?

93
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:27,627
Mrs. Reynholm... Can
I call you Victoria?

94
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:28,207
No.

95
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,007
Mrs. Reynholm.

96
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:34,027
Sometimes there is a day
and then there is a night.

97
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,027
Sometimes there is a morn,

98
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,327
and then there is an eve.

99
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:43,307
Flowers grow, trees are cut down,

100
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,507
babies are born, but...

101
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,847
Lawyers exist.

102
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:50,927
What are you trying to say?

103
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,707
I can't do it, I just can't.

104
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,387
Let me guess.
My husband wants to leave me

105
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:02,277
and he paid you a large amount of money,
so you'd spare him the embarrassment of facing me.

106
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,567
Yes, but I'm not going
to take the money... I feel sick.

107
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:08,547
Of course, you do,
you're a normal person.

108
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:10,167
You're not upset?

109
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:11,987
No, because I'm not a normal person.

110
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,047
You see, what you're trying
to do here but can't...

111
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:18,227
If the tables were turned,
I wouldn't find it difficult at all.

112
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,327
In fact, it's how I met his first wife.

113
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,327
I didn't know these were edible too.

114
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:26,447
They're not.

115
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,307
What's all that?

116
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,347
I have to spend the afternoon with Douglas.

117
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,727
Somehow I've been drafted
into his legal eagle fantasy.

118
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,307
Have you ever spent any
serious time with that man?

119
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,327
He's unbelievable! You should
hear the way he talks about women.

120
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:49,327
Oh yeah, he's some piece of
work. He's like a sexy Hitler.

121
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:53,547
I mean, I don't expect
to put on a pedal stool,

122
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:55,607
but please, show a little respect!

123
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,847
I'm sorry, you don't
expect to be put on a what?

124
00:06:58,097 --> 00:06:59,447
On a pedal stool.

125
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,267
A pedal stool?

126
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,287
What's a pedal stool?

127
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,807
You know, you put women on it

128
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,387
when you admire them,
you know, the phrase.

129
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,887
Oh yeah, the famous phrase,
«to be put on a pedal stool».

130
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:16,867
«Pedestal»!

131
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:17,927
What?

132
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,927
«Pedestal» is the word!

133
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:21,627
What's a «pedal stool»?!

134
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,367
Did you really think there was
such a thing as a pedal stool?

135
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,927
Shut up, everyone has blind spots.

136
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:32,127
Can you help me sort
through this legal crap, please, Moss?

137
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,947
I'd rather not. I've not had good
experiences with the legal system.

138
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:36,607
How come?

139
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,867
How come? Well, when I was 11, I broke
the patio window, and my mother sued me.

140
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,507
She sued you?

141
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:45,587
Yeah, to teach me a lesson.

142
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,647
She's always been a very
aggressive litigator.

143
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,907
Can you even do that,
can you sue your children?

144
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:54,067
It was kind of a show
trial in the kitchen.

145
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,487
She made a little gallery for the cat.

146
00:07:58,507 --> 00:07:59,467
What happened?

147
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:00,647
She won.

148
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,067
I'm still paying costs.

149
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,407
«Pedal stool»!

150
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:13,007
212 million quid!

151
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,687
You can't be serious!

152
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,687
We're quite serious, Mr. Reynholm.

153
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,787
But that's enough to bring
Reynholm Industries to its knees!

154
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,727
Bloody blast, this is up my arse!

155
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,467
That is the amount,
it is not up for negotiation.

156
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,967
Balls from hell, you shit-twins!

157
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:31,027
Calm down, Mr. Reynholm.

158
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,927
Bollocks to be telling me
to calm down, my old chap.

159
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,927
She wants 220 titty million quid
and you tell me to calm down!

160
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,287
You're fired.

161
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:40,447
I'm not your lawyer.

162
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:43,447
Piss off! I'm going to represent myself.

163
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:45,527
I'm not your lawyer.

164
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,917
You sit there, all confident.

165
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,427
Yeah? But when this goes to Court,
that's when the talking stops.

166
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,407
Mr. Reynholm,

167
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:55,687
there might actually be
more talking in Court,

168
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,517
this would actually be a comparatively small
amount of talking, what we're doing here.

169
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,247
I see.

170
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:00,997
Sorry.

171
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,607
No, that's all right,
it's what I pay you for.

172
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,037
Look at her. Cold as ice.

173
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:10,027
But I tell you this,
behind those shades, she's terrified.

174
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:18,547
One thing you should
know about me, Jen...

175
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:21,707
When I put my mind to
something, it gets done.

176
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:25,127
Representing myself is
the kind of challenge I relish.

177
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,367
Well, you'll have to do a lot of preparation.

178
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:28,907
Bring it on!

179
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:53,907
What's this?

180
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,887
It's my suit. I made it
myself. Took me a few days!

181
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,607
How did you find time
to prepare for the trial?

182
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,607
How did I what?

183
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,327
Mrs. Reynholm, you say that
in the short time you were married,

184
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:09,167
you became indispensable to Mr. Reynholm...

185
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,587
in what way were you indispensable?

186
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,347
I had to brush his teeth.

187
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:14,587
Really?

188
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:15,347
Yes.

189
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:17,167
That's not an expression?

190
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:18,087
No.

191
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,837
You got the brush,

192
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:22,557
you applied toothpaste to it,

193
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:24,907
you moved it into his mouth...

194
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,987
and moved your hand up and down.

195
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,587
Well, if I didn't do
it, he wouldn't do it.

196
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:33,847
Make a note... «brush teeth».

197
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,007
Now, you're asking for
quite a large amount.

198
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,847
I think it is an appropriate amount.

199
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:40,767
Bollocks.

200
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:42,787
Mr. Reynholm.

201
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:44,467
Yes, Your Honour?

202
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,267
I would ask you to refrain from using
that kind of language in my courtroom.

203
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:54,527
And which word in particular
do you object to, Your Honour?

204
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,607
You only said one.

205
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:57,987
Could you read it back?

206
00:10:58,727 --> 00:10:59,427
«Bollocks».

207
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:00,967
Don't read it back!

208
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:06,787
Why do you say it is
an appropriate amount?

209
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:09,227
Mr. Reynholm caused me great distress.

210
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:11,087
I'm entitled to some restitution.

211
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:16,087
Besides, it's not as if he ever put
the money to good use. As the film proves.

212
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,787
Your Honour, may I present the
central exhibit to our case...

213
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,487
It is, I'm afraid, a sex tape.

214
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:22,887
A sex tape?

215
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:24,987
Which one?

216
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:36,477
The alien craft appears
to have dropped its shields.

217
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,007
Thank you, Female Chekhov! Female
Sulu, beam their Captain aboard.

218
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,227
But... Captain...are you sure?

219
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,327
But she's hurt, she may need our help.

220
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:49,727
Jim, even if she's injured
as you say, I can't do an examination

221
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:52,047
on a new species
without proper research.

222
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:55,327
Dammit, Jim, I'm a sexy doctor,

223
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,807
not a sexy scientist!

224
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,427
Female Sulu. You have your orders.

225
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:02,837
Perhaps the good doctor thinks

226
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:05,647
certain alien species do not
fall under the Hippocratic oath.

227
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:10,027
I have never refused treatment to
a patient, Female Spock, and you know that!

228
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,027
I think we've seen enough.

229
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,107
Your Honour, I object!

230
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,267
There's a brilliant bit coming up.

231
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:29,487
Mr. Reynholm, are you ready to start
your cross-examination of Mrs. Reynholm?

232
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,627
I am, Your Honour, but rest assured,

233
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:34,887
it will be a normal examination.

234
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,487
I am not in any way cross.

235
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,427
You are Victoria Reynholm, are you not?

236
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,467
Mr. Reynholm, we have
already established that.

237
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:49,227
Might I suggest that you try less
to do an impression of a lawyer

238
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:54,347
you once saw on the television and make
your case as simply as you possibly can.

239
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,747
Wise words, my learned lud.

240
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:02,107
Victoria, you've spoken
about the real me,

241
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:06,407
and I think it's time we heard
a little about the real you.

242
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,827
Isn't it true, that you...

243
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,327
Used to be a man?

244
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:14,547
No.

245
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,747
It isn't true, you say?

246
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:18,447
It is untrue.

247
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,807
Who am I thinking of?

248
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:27,427
I think you mean April,
the woman you had a fight with.

249
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,027
No further questions, my lud.

250
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:35,267
What? Your entire case rested on that?

251
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,627
Yes, Your Honour.

252
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,707
No, wait, Mr. Reynholm, you can't leave it at that.

253
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:43,387
Your Honour, may I confer with
my relationship manager? What's up, Jen?

254
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:47,047
You've got to request more time
to prepare a proper defence.

255
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:50,067
Your Grace, may I approach the bench?

256
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:51,447
Have you brushed your teeth?

257
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:52,667
No.

258
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:53,787
No. Then you may not.

259
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:56,487
Your Grace,

260
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,127
I need to prepare a proper defence.

261
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,807
The one I just did there was rubbish.

262
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:08,047
Yes, he's some piece of work.

263
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:11,347
We're all very happy
at Reynholm Industries.

264
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:14,747
Are you telling the truth?

265
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:15,767
Yes.

266
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:18,347
Then why are you so ill-at-ease?

267
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:19,447
Well...

268
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:24,547
If you must know... I was in
a court myself very recently...

269
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:26,407
This very courtroom in fact,

270
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:30,467
where I gave testimony
against a former soldier who...

271
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:35,827
I was having a massage
and he kissed me on my bottom, Your Honour.

272
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:38,967
I see.

273
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,987
I'm sure you can
understand my discomfort.

274
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,427
Are you all right? Can you continue?

275
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,987
I can continue. Thank you.

276
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,107
The way you tell it, your employer
sounds like a paragon of virtue.

277
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:54,567
That's right.
And, furthermore, I would like

278
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,587
to say at this point that I think
this whole case to be a damp squid.

279
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:01,087
Thank you, no further questions.

280
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:03,867
I have one more
question, Your Honour.

281
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,547
Yes?

282
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,387
What did you say?

283
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,027
What?

284
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:13,007
What did you say the case was?
May I have it read back please?

285
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,227
«I believe this entire case
to be a bit of a damp squid.»

286
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:17,907
«A damp squid?»

287
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,567
What does that mean?

288
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,907
Jen, it's an expression.

289
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,567
It means that I believe

290
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,967
that everything that's been said
in this case, everyone already knew.

291
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,547
Yes, but did you say «damp squid»?

292
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:32,927
That's right.

293
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,947
Did you not mean «damp squib»?

294
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:38,867
No, it's «squid».

295
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,047
What's a squib?

296
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,807
It's not «squid».
Squids are already damp!

297
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,367
Hence the phrase!

298
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:48,747
Your Honour! Please!

299
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,287
It is «squib».

300
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:54,787
I must say, I find it extraordinary
that you, a man in your early 30s,

301
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:58,547
could have reached this point in your
life without knowing that it is «squib».

302
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,367
I think it's «squid».

303
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:02,887
I have no further questions.

304
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,047
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

305
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:04,747
That will be all.

306
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,027
Everyone has a blind spot!

307
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:07,327
I said that will be all!

308
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,307
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

309
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:26,567
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

310
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,367
Sorry, bit nervous... So... Yeah...

311
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:35,527
Fizzy! It's very fizzy.

312
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,707
It's fizzy. Gone fizzy.

313
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:38,127
Come on!

314
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,467
That's electric.
That's electric in there.

315
00:16:43,187 --> 00:16:44,087
Just got a shock.

316
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:48,107
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

317
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:49,707
It is not.

318
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,387
Sorry, yeah, I'm sorry.

319
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,647
My mother sued me.

320
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,667
Relax. Take your time.

321
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:01,847
Try to answer the questions
as clearly as you can.

322
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:03,847
Thank you, my love.

323
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,307
Your name is Maurice Moss, is it not?

324
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:22,187
Chair. It was the chair's fault.

325
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,847
No further questions, my lud.

326
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,787
Don't you have anything?

327
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,947
She's going to take you to
the cleaners, Mr. Reynholm.

328
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,967
Yup, I suppose she will.

329
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:42,967
What's that?

330
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,587
Oh, God.

331
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,267
I think I may have found our miracle.

332
00:18:55,707 --> 00:18:57,807
Can you state your full name, please?

333
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,087
Richmond Felicity Avenal.

334
00:19:06,157 --> 00:19:08,267
And you worked
at Reynholm Industries for a time?

335
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:09,807
I did, for over four years.

336
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,067
And what did you do?

337
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,247
I don't know.

338
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,207
Why did you leave?

339
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,687
Well, my life wasn't really going
anywhere. I was part of the whole

340
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:22,647
goth, death metal subculture
but it wasn't making me happy.

341
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,107
It was all a bit gloomy.

342
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:28,307
It was round about that
point that I developed scurvy.

343
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,467
Now that sounds unpleasant.

344
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:35,267
On the contrary. Catching scurvy was
the best thing that ever happened to me.

345
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,387
It made me take a long hard look in the mirror.

346
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,467
And I didn't like what I saw, I can tell you that.

347
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:42,147
Not just because my teeth had fallen out.

348
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,927
Which is why I founded From Goth2Boss.

349
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,087
Is it okay if I play a DVD?

350
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,867
Does it have anything
whatsoever to do with this case?

351
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:52,707
Not really, Your Honour.

352
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,147
Then you may proceed.

353
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,927
Where are you going? Is it to the top?

354
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,687
If not, why not?

355
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:01,047
Go to the bloody top!
Is it because you're a goth?

356
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:04,847
Did you know that goths have
some of the lowest life satisfaction levels

357
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,647
of any subculture with
the exception of traffic wardens?

358
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,407
That's why you don't see
any goth traffic wardens.

359
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,787
That would be a deadly combination!

360
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:16,167
We at Goth2Boss work with goths
at various locations around the UK

361
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:17,967
to bring out their hidden potential

362
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:21,587
by encouraging them to engage
in everyday, healthy pursuits

363
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,127
such as sports.

364
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,767
Mixing with other humans.

365
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,187
Extended laughter sessions.

366
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,547
Introducing colour to your wardrobe.

367
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,267
Just look at these results.
This is Debbie. She used to

368
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,787
hang around railway stations
with her hands in her sleeves.

369
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:38,647
Now she's a lifeguard in Mumbai!

370
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,127
From Goth2Boss, you know it makes
sense. Unless you're not a goth,

371
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,587
in which case, from
Goth2Boss. Remember the name.

372
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,347
But what does that have to do with

373
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,307
my divorce proceedings, m'kind fellow?

374
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,747
Well, Mr. Reynholm, I'm here
to tell you that that woman

375
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,927
is not Victoria Reynholm!

376
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,767
Her name is Melanie Crawford,

377
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,947
a former From Goth2Boss pupil of mine!

378
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,447
Sing, you canary!

379
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:12,407
Well, during our sessions, she seemed
more interested in you than getting better.

380
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,587
I don't think she ever truly
exorcised the goth within.

381
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:17,707
Scratch away that fake tan

382
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:21,067
and beneath you'll find
the purest white foundation!

383
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:26,207
Yeah, that was more of
a phrase than anything.

384
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:31,347
Actually... No, sorry, that's not her!

385
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,987
Sorry about that. That's not her.

386
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,007
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

387
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:45,787
You've heard a few things over the
past few days, none of which cast me

388
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,687
in a particularly favourable light.

389
00:21:48,047 --> 00:21:54,267
Stories of expensive sex tapes,
rumours of me killing my first wife.

390
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,107
No. No one's mentioned that.

391
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,847
You know, there's one
thing I do want to say.

392
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:06,647
Just one thing, that I...

393
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,487
Mr. Reynholm?

394
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,387
Mr. Reynholm, please.

395
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:26,447
Mr. Reynholm, this really is
the most pathetic display I have ever seen.

396
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:28,107
May I say something, Your Honour?

397
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,307
Why not?

398
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,607
Lying here,

399
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,867
pretending to have a heart
attack, you see a desperate man.

400
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:38,267
Not pretending.

401
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:42,047
A man who has exhausted
all of his time, all of his resources,

402
00:22:42,507 --> 00:22:48,147
on an expensive trial that
has resulted in... humiliation.

403
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:54,377
But think not of him.
Think of theemployees of Reynholm Industries.

404
00:22:54,897 --> 00:22:57,617
Think of the man
who was sued by his mother.

405
00:22:57,617 --> 00:23:02,947
The simpleton who thought
the phrase «damp squid» was correct.

406
00:23:03,787 --> 00:23:08,327
These are the people I want you
to consider when making your judgement.

407
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:13,527
For Reynholm is not just
the name of this ridiculous man

408
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,747
who keeps opening his eyes
whenever he thinks no one's looking.

409
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:23,267
Reynholm is the name of the family
his employees have found in each other.

410
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,267
We are all Reynholms.

411
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,727
Hurt him, and you hurt...

412
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,687
All right then,
we'll take 70 million.

413
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:35,447
Hooray!

414
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:39,547
I'm getting oak.

415
00:23:40,947 --> 00:23:45,307
