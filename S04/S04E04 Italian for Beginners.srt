1
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:49,557
I'm sorry guys, I wish I could've
come here with a better news.

2
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:51,457
But, according to these projections.

3
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,837
Reynholm Industries is
in a critical position.

4
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,737
We took a major downturn last year.

5
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:58,477
Like the rest of the economy.

6
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:04,027
And as a result, we have estimated
losses at well of a £400 million.

7
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:07,167
Before we go on, Linda.
Do you need to go to the toilet?

8
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:08,687
No.

9
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,897
Then why are you
doing a wee-wee walk?

10
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,817
It's incredibly odd and distracting.

11
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:18,167
– Maybe it's just me?
– No, is not just you Douglas. I also find it very distracting.

12
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,387
Sorry Linda.

13
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:20,787
Don't worry about it, Jen.

14
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,577
It is not a wee-wee walk.

15
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:26,547
I'm actualy doing Around-the-world
virtual-triathlon-for-charity, using...

16
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:28,657
...an iPhone application and Google Maps.

17
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,527
Look, I'm in Spain.

18
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,407
God, that's hugely impressive.

19
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,097
Haven't you just had a baby?

20
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,097
So they tell me.

21
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,427
Ah, for God's sake.

22
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:47,237
Sorry, did that sound like words?

23
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:52,747
Now, do go on.
And congratulation on getting an iPhone.

24
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,727
I say, we get in Silvio Bernatellii.

25
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:58,827
Bernatelli ?

26
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,907
The most successfull
businessman of the year.

27
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:08,487
Why a word from him
can make or break a business.

28
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:11,917
Look, Reynholm Industries is in a tough spot.

29
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,737
But with Bernatelli as investor?
I Think we can come out on top.

30
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,737
This is very convincing, Linda.

31
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,857
Damn good job.
Damn good bloody good damn good job.

32
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:23,197
You're the best woman here.

33
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:26,487
You, are an excellent woman.

34
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:32,047
Linda! Bloody Linda.

35
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:35,377
I'm so good at business things...
Reynholm Industries.

36
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:38,007
God, do you have any idea
how annoying this woman is?

37
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:39,097
I haven't inkling.

38
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:43,927
I just had eureka moment.

39
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:46,907
Why do I keep my phone
in my trousers pocket?

40
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,747
It's to far...
but look at this...

41
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,747
Top pocket.

42
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:52,747
Yeah?

43
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:54,747
Not as far...

44
00:02:56,297 --> 00:02:57,327
Yeah? look at that.

45
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:01,117
See how smooth that is...
Oh, mama!

46
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:03,577
Do you see that?

47
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:05,247
You wish you saw that.

48
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,037
Sorry, did I interrupt...

49
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,367
– No
– She had a baby like yesterday, and she already...

50
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,277
...invading Spain.

51
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,107
Linda just had a baby?

52
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,087
Wow, well you'll never know...

53
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,757
What?

54
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,757
To much information.

55
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,777
What? that she had a baby?

56
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:25,877
Come on.

57
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,617
Moss, It's a natural part of life.

58
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,427
It's not a natural part
of my life...

59
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,197
And I aim to keep it that way.

60
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,737
You should be okay.

61
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,987
What's that jacket for?

62
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,147
It's not for anything, it was a
present, Julia got it for me.

63
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:46,057
– How is Julia the orphan?
– Don't call her that.

64
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,407
– Why?
– That's the first thing you told us about her.

65
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:51,337
I totaly think of her
as Julia the orphan.

66
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,237
Well, get out of the habbit of it.
What if it slip out...

67
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,537
...when you meet her in person?

68
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:58,097
I'm hardly like to say
Hallo, Judy the Orphan, am I not?

69
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,937
I totaly would say that to her.

70
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:04,817
– Yeah, I know you would.
– But she still an orphan right?

71
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,727
Yes!

72
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:09,347
Her parents haven't
come back to life.

73
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:12,517
Have you find out the story
of what happened to them?

74
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:15,487
No, she doesn't really
like talking about it.

75
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:18,137
Why not so be curious
like I would be?

76
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:21,137
Yeah, you know what,
it's none of my business.

77
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,607
Maybe they not really dead.

78
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:27,327
Maybe she doesn't know what the word orphan means.
Maybe she thinks it just means...

79
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:28,927
House-proud.

80
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,877
I'm leaving now.

81
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,457
– Roy?
– Yeah?

82
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:38,697
What's that jacket for?

83
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:41,037
It's not for anything.

84
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,177
Will you be wearing that
all the time now?

85
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:45,807
Yeah, maybe.

86
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:48,457
Infact, Julia thinks
I can pull it of.

87
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:51,127
– You don't like it?
– It's the worst thing ever.

88
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:53,717
You look like a tall girl.

89
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,317
Maybe a little feminin.

90
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:59,227
I can understand why you
wouldn't like it then.

91
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:00,497
What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,057
Oh come on.
These Linda business...

93
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,667
...we got these, six or
seven times a week.

94
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,037
It's always the same,
it's never about a man.

95
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,217
You're just one of those woman...

96
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,127
You're one of those woman,
who don't like women.

97
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,127
Burn it.

98
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:19,057
You should burn the jacket.

99
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:24,867
And all these for Sport Relief.

100
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,887
We all have to do our bit.

101
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,637
First you made me
want to go to the toilet..

102
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,187
And now you make me
want to be a better person.

103
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,427
A bit of news on the Bernatelli
front, by the way, Douglas.

104
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,027
His translator is sick.
So we have to hire one.

105
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,027
I could translate if you want.

106
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,817
Can you speak Italian, Jen?

107
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,587
Very impressive.

108
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,697
Not before I flush the toilet.
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:07,087
Beautiful and
delicate young lady.

110
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,367
– With such a butch hand.
– Oi...

111
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:11,177
I'm kiding, I'm kidding.
You got a lovely hand.

112
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:13,367
And that's a lovely ring.
I haven't notice that before.

113
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:15,717
That was my mom's.

114
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:20,157
Oh, I'm sorry Julia I didn't mean...
I know you don't want to talk about all this.

115
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:21,827
– No, I'm sorry Roy.
– Yeah.

116
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:25,507
I should just tell you the whole story,
because you gonna have to know sooner or later.

117
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:28,807
If you dont mind,
I'd like to get it all out now.

118
00:06:29,017 --> 00:06:31,597
Just as long as we never
talk about it again.

119
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,807
There was a fire.

120
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:37,597
A fire?

121
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:40,917
Oh, God. It's awful.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

122
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,757
We were on holiday.

123
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,707
We went to a Sea Parks.

124
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:48,127
– You know, Sea Parks like the Sea World.
– Yeah, sure Sea Parks.

125
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,547
It was... during the sea lion show.

126
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:57,027
A fire...

127
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,447
...during the sea lion show...

128
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:04,607
...at Sea Parks.

129
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:11,217
The flame surround us so quickly,
and we couldn't...

130
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,747
We coulnd't...

131
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,467
– Oh, are you okay?
– I'm okay. I'm okay.

132
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:21,487
Just promise me,
we'll never talk about it again.

133
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,347
Sure, sure. of course...

134
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:31,977
– But, how the...
– I don't want to talk about it!

135
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:36,717
You don't speak Italian?

136
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,047
No.

137
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,577
Why did you say you did?

138
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,897
No one is paying attention to me.

139
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,897
So what did you actualy
say at the meeting?

140
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,207
I don't know.

141
00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:57,947
Very impressive.

142
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:06,877
He wants me to do a
conference call with him.

143
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,947
– What am I gonna do?
– All these lies, Jen.

144
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,037
This is exactly what
happened with the Iraq war.

145
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:18,267
It's not that much of a lie, Moss.
Because I have always wanted to speaks Italian...

146
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:21,687
...and I can sound like I'm
speaking Italian, so it's...

147
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,937
...more or less the same thing.

148
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:29,657
Yeah, except to Italian.
Or people who can understand Italian.

149
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,097
Exactly.

150
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,097
Oh, God.

151
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,447
I'm just gonna blue-sky this.

152
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:40,327
Would it be of any help,
what so everr...

153
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:43,817
If I were to install a voice activated
translation program on your laptop?

154
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:46,377
No, Stupid idea!
Stupid idea.

155
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,957
No, no, no, no.
A voice activated?

156
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,427
Is that mean someone would speak and
the translation would appear on the computer screen?

157
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,087
Actualy, now that you put it like that.

158
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,567
That could work.

159
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,027
Well done.

160
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,027
Good idea, Jen.

161
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:03,387
Thank you?

162
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:08,837
The Jacket!

163
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,837
He still wearing the jacket.

164
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,027
You alright, Roy?

165
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:15,027
Is it the jacket?

166
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:17,897
Because, it should be.

167
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:23,307
– No. It's um...
– What?

168
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,797
Julia told me the story.

169
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:30,857
So, what happened?

170
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:33,367
Her parent died in a fire.

171
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,367
Oh, God. I'm sorry,
that's horrible.

172
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,177
Yeah, yeah, it was a fire.

173
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:40,447
at Sea Parks.

174
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:47,947
– Sea Parks?
– Yeah.

175
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,527
– With the...
– With the whales and everything, yeah...

176
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:55,117
Well, okay.

177
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,247
– Sea Parks?
– Yeah.

178
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:12,317
– A fire?
– That's right.

179
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:17,227
At the sea lion show, apparently.

180
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:21,837
Aren't those shows
usualy out in the open?

181
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,547
Well, yeah, I mean
that's what I would've...

182
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:27,797
– Yeah.
– Lots of water everywhere.

183
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,587
Yeah, I mean, I would imagine
a whale need a lot of water.

184
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:35,157
I don't think you can have whale in a place
where there isn't a huge amount of water.

185
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,647
It just seem like a weird
place to go on fire.

186
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:42,617
It's a very weird place
to go on fire.

187
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,107
A fire?
At a Sea Parks?

188
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,797
It's the weirdest thing
I've ever heard.

189
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:49,957
Well, maybe...

190
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,597
Maybe if there were plastic seats.

191
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:55,467
– Maybe they could go..
– They don't have plastic seats at Sea Park.

192
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:56,837
How do you know?

193
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,357
Roy, when I was on holiday...

194
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,167
...I live at Sea Park.

195
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:04,457
It's the Funnest, Wettest,
most splish-splashy, place in the world.

196
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:08,867
Okay, did you go and see
the sea lion show?

197
00:11:09,017 --> 00:11:10,867
Three times a day,
for two weeks.

198
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:13,967
– And do they have plastic...
– No, it's all stone steps.

199
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,287
They won't went on fire.

200
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:21,437
I've check wikipedia, there is no
mention of a fire at any Sea Parks.

201
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,537
Do you think maybe she's lying?

202
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,817
No, I mean, why would she lied?

203
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,257
And if she was going to lie,
why would she used this one?

204
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,577
A fire at a Sea Parks.

205
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,577
It's wrecked in my head.

206
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:40,487
I mean, if she has said that her parent are drowned,
I'd be the happiest man in the world.

207
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,167
But, a fire?

208
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,277
At a Sea Parks?

209
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:46,117
Well, it's just...
It's just... oh...

210
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,417
..it open up a lot of question..

211
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,647
– Maybe, you could ask her?
– No, no, no, no.

212
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,237
We can never talk about it again.

213
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:57,127
– Well, maybe you could just...
– No, no, no, no, no.

214
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,747
We can never talk about it
for the rest of our lifes.

215
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,707
Well, I suppose you just going
to have to try stop thinking about it.

216
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:08,407
That's another great idea.

217
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,677
You're on fire.

218
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:12,677
If you pardon the expression.

219
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,577
I would be very happy
to come and have a look.

220
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,397
Next week, is good for me.

221
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,637
We're certainly looking
forward to your visit.

222
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:34,647
We can't wait to give you the full
Reynholm Industries experience.

223
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:49,657
He says he's looking
forward to meeting me.

224
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,537
Ciao.

225
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,277
Maybe, you're the best woman.

226
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:09,247
Twelve exits.

227
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,407
There are twelve exits.

228
00:13:14,037 --> 00:13:15,407
What are you doing?

229
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,637
– What?
– What are you doing on the computer?

230
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,377
Masturbating.

231
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:56,997
Isn't Bernatelli today?
Shouldn't you be preparing?

232
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,267
No, I think I'm okay, Moss.

233
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,007
I've learn a few conversational basics...

234
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:04,017
...so when he gets going,
I just fire up this baby.

235
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:08,407
I do wanna feel refreshed though,
at the meeting, so I'm gonna to sleep...

236
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:10,407
...for a few hours.

237
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,067
Is that what you having for lunch?

238
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:19,067
A big pile of mashed potatoes.

239
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:21,067
I fancy it.

240
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,287
It's a Sea Parks, isn't it?

241
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:28,457
You're building a Sea Parks
out of mashed potatoes.

242
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,137
There are twelve exits, Moss.

243
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,177
Twelve exits!
For only 200 people.

244
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,337
You don't close encounters crazy, Roy.

245
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,097
– You need to let it go.
– To have killed anyone...

246
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:45,047
...the fire has to start,
here, here, and here.

247
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:47,047
And close in like this.

248
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:48,557
But, how is it spreaded?

249
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,987
There is no wood
in a Sea Parks arena.

250
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:52,707
And why there is no wood?

251
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,357
Because it's rots.

252
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,897
And why does it's rots?

253
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:58,397
Because of all the water...

254
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:03,427
Damn, that mash look tasty.

255
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,547
Password?

256
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,077
It didn't asked for password before...

257
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,077
Moss?

258
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:18,517
Where's Moss?

259
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,977
It's payday, he's probably go to Namco.

260
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,827
Where's Namco?

261
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:38,097
It's an iPhone, there's flipping
iPhone in the flipping machine.

262
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,727
I run out of coin.

263
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:54,077
Moss!

264
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:56,847
Moss.

265
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,047
What am I gonna do.

266
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:18,917
What are you..

267
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,917
How did you get in there?

268
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,917
Through the hole.

269
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,707
Why?

270
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,547
There's an iPhone, Jen.
An actual iPhone.

271
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:31,887
I need your password,
I need the password...

272
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,617
..for the translations program.

273
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:35,127
Help me get the iPhone first.

274
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,397
– I can't lift my arms.
– No.

275
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,537
I need to get it through the shoots,
someone else will take it if you don't.

276
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,367
I'm sure they're not giving it away,
the enginer must've droped it.

277
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:45,887
No, no, no, It's the price.
It's the price, you got to help me.

278
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:49,027
– I don't have time.
– But, it's an IPhone, Jen.

279
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:52,247
I may able to get an iPhone without
giving any money to Apple.

280
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:54,027
I'll be living the dreams.

281
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,797
What's the password?

282
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,617
Moss, the password.

283
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,147
Moss!

284
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:00,727
Moss!

285
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:04,247
Oh, I'm so excited about
the sea lion show.

286
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:09,147
Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome...

287
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:10,947
Luigi...

288
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,957
Joe...

289
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,107
..and, Slippery Pete.

290
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:22,257
Oh, no. Whats all these smoke?

291
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,517
What smoke?

292
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,257
Oh, yeah, smoke...

293
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:37,997
Where is it?

294
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,217
There must be blocking it.

295
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,557
I'll try to move to
clear the passage.

296
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,467
Come on, Moss.

297
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:56,277
Come on, Moss.
You can do it.

298
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,027
Push

299
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:00,217
Come on, Moss.

300
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,217
Keep breathing.

301
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,417
– Push!
– Shut up!

302
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:05,937
You can do it, Moss.

303
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,157
– I hate you!
– Why are saying that?

304
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,277
I don't know!
Stop talking!

305
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,497
Come on, Moss.

306
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,137
Come on. That's it.

307
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,347
It's coming... I can see,
I can see the start button

308
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,087
Come on, Moss, push.

309
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:23,997
One, two, three... Push!

310
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,137
Come on, Moss.
Push!

311
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,847
Push!

312
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:39,217
It's beautiful.

313
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,087
Password!

314
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:47,957
Where the hell have you been?

315
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:49,297
Sorry, it's just...

316
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:50,397
Doesn't matter.

317
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,157
So far, he satisfied
with Jen we laugh at.

318
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,937
Mr. Bernatelli, meet Jen.

319
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,167
Leave that laptop outside.

320
00:19:14,577 --> 00:19:17,167
– No. What?
– We have to think about security, Jen.

321
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,817
How do we know that laptop, isn't
somehow able to connect to the internet?

322
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:25,767
– No, no. It is a...
– Then get it out of here!

323
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:33,557
Look, look at this, look how
long it takes to go on fire.

324
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,247
And these made of matches.

325
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:41,027
First of all, I like to extend the
warmest welcome to Mr. Bernatelli.

326
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:44,897
And how today, is the begining
of a long and fruitful partnership.

327
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:16,077
He said, It's a pleasure to be here.

328
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:19,717
I see, so...

329
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:22,127
If the fire start here,

330
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:23,457
and they were there,

331
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,517
and there's no way the could've escape.

332
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,837
So, they must've been there.

333
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,087
I should stop it.

334
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,817
Aw, my hands!

335
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:54,017
I have always wanted to visit England.

336
00:20:57,127 --> 00:21:01,887
I'm looking forward to something.
Some of your famous english food.

337
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,647
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

338
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:15,437
– So, what are you wanna talk about?
– Alright, now you listen to me, Bernatelli.

339
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:20,137
I hope by the end of this meeting
we could become friend friends

340
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:25,127
I like you, and I like what
you've done with your company.

341
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:29,187
Hopely we can join forces,

342
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:31,427
and plow away through
each uncertain times.

343
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:37,547
What do you say?

344
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:40,337
Bernatelli and Reynholm Industries.

345
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,647
Together will be bigger than ever.

346
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:52,347
Hey, I'm gonna stand up,
and start talking slightly louder.

347
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,797
Do you like my suit or not?

348
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,707
The woman to my left,
smell likes she's been for a run

349
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,487
This meeting is going better
than you might think.

350
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,737
I love what you have
done with this office.

351
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,367
Can I borrow some
of your erotic arts?

352
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:20,887
For how long?

353
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:36,087
On second thoughts,
I'm gonna go.

354
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,437
Never contact me again,
because I'm mental.

355
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,477
Well, that's a waste of time.

356
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:48,017
Next time you have a bright idea, Linda.
Keep it to yourself.

357
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:50,777
– But...
– Oh, for God's sake, get a shower.

358
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:56,877
– Oh, my god, Roy.
– Oh, ya...

359
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:00,117
Oh, my God, you poor thing.

360
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,887
Your hands...

361
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:03,797
How did they happen?

362
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,507
It's kind of hard to explain.

363
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,967
– But, what...
– I don't want to talk about it.

364
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,347
Moss!

365
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,207
Hallo...

366
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:25,497
Hallo...

367
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:29,707
starting to get pretty lonely now.

368
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,107
These toys may smell of wee.
count them all.
