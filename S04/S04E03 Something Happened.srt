«The IT Crowd»:
season 4, episode 3

2
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:30,898
Space.

3
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:32,865
What is it?

4
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:36,295
The simple answer is,
we don't know.

5
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,835
Or at least, we didn't know until now.

6
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,833
Hello, I'm Douglas Reynholm.

7
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:44,007
And I'm not a scientist,
but I do have a better understanding

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,863
of what space is
than any scientist living today.

9
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:51,296
Where did I gain these insights?
From this man.

10
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:55,316
The founder of Spaceology,
Beth Gaga Shaggy,

11
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:58,874
no relation to either
Lady Gaga or Shaggy,

12
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,202
is the founder of Spaceology.

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,618
A religion, not a cult.

14
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,702
In other words,
when it comes to space,

15
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,142
he's the man with his
head screwed on tight.

16
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:12,242
This is what he told me when I
met him on holiday two weeks ago.

17
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:16,476
Space is invisible mind dust
and stars are but wishes.

18
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,542
I mean, think about that!

19
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,502
That means every star you
can see in the night sky

20
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,862
is a wish that has come true.

21
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:26,582
And they've come true

22
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,942
because of something he
calls Spacestar Ordering.

23
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:34,629
Spacestar Ordering is based on
the twin scientific principles

24
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,686
of star maths and wishy thinking.

25
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,374
If you'd like to know more,

26
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,112
there are thousands of
Spaceology centers all over the UK.

27
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:45,482
If that doesn't convince you,

28
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,202
well, then, maybe you just don't
deserve to get what you want.

29
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,524
Wow. You're a genius, Ray!
Love the special effects!

30
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,140
How did you do that thing
where I'm spinning around?

31
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,342
Well, in that bit,
you're actually spinning around.

32
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:02,936
I'm glad you like the website,
Mr Reynholm.

33
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,452
I did spend
quite a lot of time on it.

34
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:08,042
It's brilliant, and well
worth every penny of the 50.

35
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,202
100 pounds.
Didn't we say 100 pounds?

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,342
I never would have agreed to that.

37
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:16,945
Jen! Guess who wanted
a helicopter this time last week

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,897
and now, thanks to
Spacestar Ordering, has one?

39
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:22,546
You?

40
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:25,608
I'll give you a clue.
It ain't these chaps!

41
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:28,402
You?

42
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:31,842
You're a sceptic, Jen.
You should be more like these.

43
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,077
They can't get enough of
my Spacestar Ordering story.

44
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:39,406
Yes, yes, I noticed you've been
coming down here a lot more often

45
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,522
because of all the questions.

46
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:45,553
So, Mr. Reynholm, how did the
cosmos grant you a helicopter?

47
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,482
Well, I visualised the thing I wanted.

48
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:52,242
In my case, it was a helicopter.
I drew a picture of the helicopter

49
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:56,082
on a piece of paper, then I
stood with my back to space,

50
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,882
threw the paper over my
shoulder and wished really hard.

51
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,061
When you say that you stood
with your back to space...

52
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,306
– Yes.
– ...how exactly did you achieve that?

53
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,358
I waited till night time.

54
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,725
Of course.

55
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:12,322
Couple of days later,
bought myself a helicopter.

56
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:14,442
Explain that one, if you can!

57
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:18,202
I wish the cosmos would make it
slightly harder to find our office.

58
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,522
Don't worry, Jen,
you'll get your wish,

59
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,092
just as I one day,
I'll get my robot hand.

60
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:28,362
Scientific mind,
believes in Spacestar Ordering.

61
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,288
Who's getting the robot hand first?

62
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:37,279
Hey, you're still up
for tonight, right?

63
00:03:37,288 --> 00:03:39,079
I'll go if Moss goes.

64
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,881
Sorry, Jen. I find music
confusing and annoying.

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,678
Roy invited me to a gig once.
I didn't really enjoy it.

66
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,972
You went to the wrong address.
You went to a swimming pool.

67
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:51,811
Are you sure it's not swimming pools

68
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:53,585
that you find
confusing and annoying?

69
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,319
You're right.

70
00:03:57,328 --> 00:04:00,256
It's not music I hate,
it's swimming!

71
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:03,233
You know what?
I will come, Roy.

72
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:15,371
Where's Moss? I can't believe
he's missing out on this.

73
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,176
Where are they?

74
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:27,519
I'm going to have
to go dance at the front.

75
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:29,959
Aren't you a bit old
for the front?

76
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,479
I'm 31!

77
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,934
Good for you, mate!

78
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:44,892
Careful! My foot!

79
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:52,530
You chill out, man!

80
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:55,939
Jesus!

81
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,623
Get out of town! You hooked
up with someone from the band?

82
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:26,476
– Wow, who was it?
– Norman.

83
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,732
Norman? He's the drummer, right?

84
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:30,523
The keyboard player.

85
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,702
The keyboard player?

86
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,870
Okay.

87
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,943
– What?
– No, it's just...

88
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:40,559
The keyboard player? Really?

89
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,799
Yeah. What?

90
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,562
It's just he's a bit geeky, isn't he?

91
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:44,984
I didn't think
he was your type.

92
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,202
Jen's going out with a geek!

93
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,759
Are you sure it's not just
because he's in a band?

94
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,879
Yes. I really am that shallow, Roy!

95
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,194
I know you are.

96
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,179
Yeah, I'm that shallow.

97
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:59,675
You are, though. I mean,
you really, really are.

98
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,452
Look, I like him.

99
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:04,194
He doesn't say a lot,
he's more of a thinker.

100
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,181
I think he's really cool.

101
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,257
It's because he's in a band!

102
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,759
– Flippin' hell.
– Is this your back again?

103
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:13,279
When did mosh pits
become so unruly?

104
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,159
I told you, you should get a massage.

105
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,280
I've never enjoyed
having massages.

106
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,124
I don't like being naked
in front of strangers,

107
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:24,426
and I can never relax if I think
someone might play Norah Jones.

108
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,959
Who wants to hear another
Spacestar Ordering success story?

109
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:30,639
Wait, wait! Yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,210
Okay, okay.

111
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:33,833
Go!

112
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,763
Last week, I decided I wanted
to learn how to do tattoos.

113
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,519
So, I did the business.

114
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,439
Bought a book on tattoos, read it,

115
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:45,119
and now I know how to do tattoos. Look!

116
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,159
My helicopter!

117
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,585
That's brilliant.

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,827
Let me see it...

119
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,515
What the bloody hell's
wrong with you?

120
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,991
I have a really bad back.

121
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,119
You should see a masseuse.

122
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:58,038
Don't see a masseuse!

123
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:01,851
They're the biggest con
of the 20th century.

124
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:07,468
I had a bad back, and I cured it,
thanks to the techniques outlined

125
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,492
in this groundbreaking expose
of the massage industry.

126
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,234
Go like this.

127
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,182
And push your back up.

128
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:23,765
For f...!

129
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,999
That's worse!
That's way worse.

130
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:28,359
It's terrible, isn't it?

131
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:30,239
You told me
that would make it better!

132
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,304
No, no, no! That's how I
originally injured my back.

133
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,740
– You all right?
– Yeah!

134
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:44,639
Feels so much better already!

135
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:47,319
So that's why I ended up
joining the parachute regiment.

136
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,827
Yeah, the Paras.

137
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:52,679
That's the one I would have joined.

138
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,773
But you know, fear of heights...

139
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,919
Were you in the army?

140
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:58,765
No.

141
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:07,839
Right, I have to do a bit
of work on your thighs.

142
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,085
Hey, you do what you need to do.

143
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:21,163
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

144
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:25,212
What was Mancini thinking?

145
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,702
The thing about Arsenal is,
they always try and walk it in.

146
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,078
Arsenal?

147
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,319
Whoever we're talking about.

148
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,491
Right...

149
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,312
Nearly done.

150
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:40,763
Thanks again, man,
this really does feel so much better.

151
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,199
Right.

152
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,599
Yeah!

153
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,366
There we are. All finished.

154
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:57,764
I love him I love him,
I love him so...

155
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,179
Goodness me!

156
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,538
What would you term
what just happened there?

157
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:08,469
Norman says my voice is extraordinary.

158
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,351
He's right.

159
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:13,851
This is it, you know.

160
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,367
This is the guy.

161
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:17,063
This is the big one.

162
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,906
There's nothing about him
I don't like.

163
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,761
When he's asleep,
he makes this sound...

164
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,867
...a lovely, little, gentle purr.

165
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,742
This is a long song.

166
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,254
You know, the last few days
has been indescribable.

167
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,555
Good.

168
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:07,010
Hi, Roy!

169
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,800
Hi, Roy.

170
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:09,949
What?

171
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,818
You okay?

172
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:15,783
What?

173
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:17,958
Are you all right?

174
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:29,677
Is your back still hurting?
Didn't you go to see the masseuse?

175
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:31,194
Yes, I did.

176
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,583
Did it help?

177
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:35,751
No.

178
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:38,615
Are you okay?

179
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,786
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, fine.

180
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:45,216
It's just that you've got the same face
that you have when you eat vegetables.

181
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,254
Okay.

182
00:10:55,556 --> 00:10:57,099
Something happened.

183
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:00,083
Something happened?

184
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:04,560
Yes. When I was getting the massage,
the masseuse did something.

185
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,029
Go on.

186
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,122
Okay, I'm going to tell you,
but have to promise

187
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:20,102
not to laugh at me, because this
whole thing has left me very shaken.

188
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,474
– Okay. I promise I will not laugh.
– Okay.

189
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:28,240
He kissed me on the arse.

190
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,919
Sorry, I may have
misheard you there, Roy.

191
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,810
What did you just say?

192
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,432
I was enjoying the massage,

193
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,372
everything had gone very, very well,

194
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:50,177
but then at the end
he just leaned down,

195
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:52,662
and he gave me a big kiss
on the arse.

196
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,378
And you thought
I'd find that funny?!

197
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,373
Well, yeah, I suppose I did.

198
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:10,034
On what planet
would that be funny?

199
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,119
Whereabouts on the arse
did he kiss you?

200
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,839
I don't know,
just to the left of the...

201
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,034
the line that goes down
the middle.

202
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,730
The cleftal horizon.

203
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:24,517
– Is that what it's called?
– Yes, it is, but never mind that.

204
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,237
– What happened next?
– Well, then

205
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,175
I just got dressed and I left.

206
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:32,978
Okay. Have you told Jen this?

207
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,394
No, I was really afraid
she'd laugh at me.

208
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:37,425
Do you think Jen's a monster?!

209
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,727
She wouldn't laugh.
This man crossed the line!

210
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,503
He is a member
of the medical profession.

211
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,808
Roy, look at me.

212
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:45,909
Look at me!

213
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,917
There is nothing funny about this.

214
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:55,568
I think he crossed the line.
I don't think it's funny.

215
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,706
I mean, I was so relaxed,

216
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:00,276
and then that just tensed me
right up again.

217
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,050
My hands were like that for an hour.

218
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,940
I couldn't get them in
to my pockets to pay him.

219
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,487
You paid him?!

220
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,979
Roy, I've got to tell you, I think
you've got grounds to sue.

221
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,323
Really?

222
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,625
What is that?!

223
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:20,550
That's Jen.

224
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:22,472
That's what she does now.

225
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,729
You should tell her.
You should tell her.

226
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,565
– What?
– Listen to this.

227
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,962
Jen, you know that I went
for that massage?

228
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:33,818
– Yeah.
– You are not going to believe this.

229
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:37,074
The bloke who did it
kissed me on my arse.

230
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,847
No, Jen, my masseuse
kissed me on my bum!

231
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,198
My body went into spasms!

232
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:51,339
My hands were like this
for an hour!

233
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,347
Stop it! You're killing me!

234
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,511
You've got to spread
that kind of material out!

235
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,175
I can't believe this!

236
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,154
So what's the problem? I know!
He doesn't write, he doesn't call!

237
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,870
What, did you think
he was coming on to you?

238
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:11,164
I don't know!

239
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:14,784
Maybe he's like the Michelangelo
of physical therapists

240
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:18,102
and that was his signature.
Maybe he does it to everybody.

241
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,917
Look, to be honest,
I don't care why he did it.

242
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:24,745
All I know is that
I was vulnerable.

243
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:28,597
I was naked,
and he kissed me on my bottom.

244
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,505
I'll tell you something, this is
not the last he has heard of me.

245
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,894
As God is my witness,
no man shall ever have to be

246
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,300
kissed on the bottom unexpectedly
because of this man ever again.

247
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,831
Will you stop laughing?!

248
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:47,964
This is the first time
I've left before you.

249
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:51,003
We're looking up legal precedents
of Roy being kissed on the arse.

250
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,776
Don't sue him, Roy.
You'll get on the news.

251
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,901
– Don't listen to her.
– Everyone will laugh!

252
00:14:56,926 --> 00:15:00,397
Noone will laugh! Come on, help
us bring this monster to justice!

253
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:03,503
I can't. The band are playing
a new song tonight.

254
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:04,754
They want my opinion.

255
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,878
You know to just say,
«It's great», right?

256
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:10,354
Roy, I am a person.
With thoughts and opinions.

257
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:12,331
No. You're not.

258
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,800
Jen, please,
just say «It's great».

259
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,710
When people like that
ask you what you think,

260
00:15:16,734 --> 00:15:19,354
all they want to hear
is that they're geniuses.

261
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:21,003
Goodbye.

262
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:26,753
She is evil.

263
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:31,393
Spacestar ordering
success story number three.

264
00:15:32,772 --> 00:15:37,112
My tattoo got infected,
so they've had to cut off my arm!

265
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,925
I am getting a robot hand!

266
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:46,440
In the war...

267
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:50,646
I am beautiful...

268
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,521
Beautiful. Really beautiful.

269
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:55,733
Thank you.

270
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:59,737
It's just a great song.
Really, really great.

271
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,708
If you put a gun to my head
and forced me to give one criticism,

272
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,673
it'd be that maybe
it goes on just a bit too long.

273
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,578
– Apart from that, perfect.
– Okay.

274
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,243
Listen, Tim, Mary's not going
to make it tonight.

275
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:23,157
What'll we do about
backing vocals?

276
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,557
I'd love to!

277
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,133
Moss, can I ask you a question?

278
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,773
Sure.

279
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:37,102
Do I have to testify?

280
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,649
I can't make that decision
for you, Roy.

281
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,357
You've just got
to ask yourself one thing.

282
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:46,632
If you don't take the stand,
how many more unsolicited bum kisses

283
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:49,577
will be administered
by that lip-happy bastard?

284
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,613
No, you're right, I know you're
right. I do want to testify.

285
00:16:53,622 --> 00:16:56,149
I'm just afraid that
they're going to laugh at me.

286
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,696
What if they're all...
What if they're all like Jen?

287
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,485
They're not going to laugh, Roy.

288
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:03,293
Noone's like Jen.

289
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,446
Noone.

290
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,937
I've come to realise
she's actually a very odd person.

291
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:12,961
Well, good luck tonight, everyone!

292
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,282
Are you a big
Stevie Nicks fan, Jen?

293
00:17:15,307 --> 00:17:16,586
Stevie Nicks?
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:20,937
God. Thanks so much for
this, guys, I'm so excited.

295
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,213
I've never done anything
like this before.

296
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:26,758
I can't believe
you want me to do it!

297
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:28,688
I won't let you down.

298
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:45,797
So, Norman, we've had a talk.

299
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,413
We think we're going to go back to
not having a keyboard in the band.

300
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,772
– Oh, no!
– Yeah, I'm sorry, but...

301
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,013
We'll see you both
again soon, yeah?

302
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,032
Wait! I'm out too?

303
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:11,173
And the defendant
gave no indication

304
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:14,250
that he had any intention
of kissing you on the bottom?

305
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,340
No indication whatsoever.

306
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:21,133
He just kissed me on my bottom.
Out of nowhere.

307
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,773
What was the result?

308
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,938
Well, I had nightmares about it.

309
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,594
And I can't stop washing my bottom.

310
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:34,282
And I find it hard to trust masseurs.

311
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:40,550
Where exactly did he kiss you?

312
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:42,208
It was in the middle.

313
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:44,053
In the middle of your bottom?

314
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:47,891
Well, just to the left
of the cleftal horizon.

315
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,587
In layman's terms,
please, Mr. Trenneman.

316
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:54,607
I'm sorry, your Honour.
Just to the left of the bum line.

317
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,213
Just above the thigh?

318
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,333
Well above the thigh.

319
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,961
It was on my bottom.

320
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,576
Although it is true, is it not,

321
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,977
that what some people
call their bottom,

322
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:10,297
others might call their hip.

323
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:13,493
No, he kissed my bottom, sir.

324
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,922
But is it not true...

325
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:17,328
He kissed me on my bottom!

326
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,305
Why is no one laughing?

327
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,813
It's no laughing matter, Jen.

328
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,453
We, Spaceologists, take this
kind of thing very seriously.

329
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,030
Are all these people Spaceologists?

330
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:38,846
Yes, this trial could bring
the massage industry to its knees.

331
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:42,897
And you'll find they take this case
with the gravity it deserves.

332
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:47,395
Perhaps Mr. Trenneman
might be able to help us

333
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,828
with the aid of this diagram.

334
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:57,039
Could you please place this
picture of the defendant...

335
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,242
...on the area where
you say he kissed you?

336
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:18,352
That was where the incident happened.

337
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:20,872
I think that's accurate.

338
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:23,139
– You think that is accurate?
– Yes.

339
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:25,016
Because only a moment ago
you were quite sure,

340
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,478
yet now you only think.

341
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,717
– You're twisting my words.
– Is it not true

342
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:31,383
that this may simply be an artist,

343
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:33,961
proud of his work,
signing off with a flourish?

344
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,293
That is not the point.

345
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,373
Yes, thank you,
Mr. Trenneman. That will be all.

346
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:39,797
My arse is not a canvas!

347
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,333
I said, that will be all,
thank you.

348
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,039
My bottom is not a kissing post, sir.

349
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,473
Okay, you can dress this up
however you like

350
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,453
with your fancy words,
but the truth remains

351
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:56,172
that man, sitting there,
kissed me on my bike rack

352
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:58,878
and I was not expecting it

353
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:02,373
and it rendered an
expensive massageworthless.

354
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:04,264
– Your Honour, please.
– And I am here today

355
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,282
so that no man need be kissed
on his sweetmeats

356
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:10,688
by this man ever again,

357
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:13,110
unless they have arranged it
beforehand for some reason.

358
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:16,446
– Will you be silent?
– I will not be silent!

359
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,313
I will never be silent!

360
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,969
I will not stop
until those lips are behind bars!

361
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:24,653
How dare you?

362
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:26,047
I trusted you.

363
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:28,629
My trouser hams
are not for sale, sir!

364
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:33,242
I put my arse in your hands.

365
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:37,539
I rest my case.

366
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:30,569
I'd have used my robot hand
for good.

367
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:54,357
Wake up!

368
