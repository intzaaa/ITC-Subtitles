00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,397
«The IT Crowd»:
season 4, episode 2

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,862
So, how much are you asking for?

3
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,622
Nothing, just take whatever
you want.

4
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:41,382
I don't want to start cluttering up
the place with old stuff, you know?

5
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:45,242
That's what this new place is about,
I want to totally reinvent myself.

6
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,858
From this moment on,
everything is going to be different.

7
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,452
Hello, IT, have you tried
turning it off and on again?

8
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,819
I did it! I did it!
I've been accepted!

9
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,302
– No!
– What's going on?

10
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,822
I've been accepted!
I applied, they said yes!

11
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,889
Who said yes?
What are you talking about...

12
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,507
Moss, you're shaking!

13
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:06,780
Consonant, please.

14
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:09,616
B...

15
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,902
And a vowel, please.

16
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,046
And lastly, A.

17
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,451
And here's the Countdown clock.

18
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,382
All right, let's see
what we've got. Jeremy?

19
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:47,344
Six.

20
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,408
– And Maurice?
– Nine.

21
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,822
Jeremy, what's your six?

22
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,093
Tenant.

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,504
And Maurice?

24
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:57,826
It actually already is a word.
Tnetennba.

25
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,881
Good heavens, really?

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,047
Could you use it
in a sentence for us?

27
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,414
Good morning,
that's a nice Tnetennba.

28
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,649
Someone reminded me,
you haven't yet got a word

29
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,982
less than eight letters long.
It's quite extraordinary.

30
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,262
You really do look
like you're on your way

31
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,182
to winning that Countdown teapot.

32
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,196
No offence, Jeremy.

33
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,622
– Who are you?!
– Want me to do your windows?

34
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,062
What?! What?!
I can't understand you.

35
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,782
There we are, mate.

36
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:49,822
No! No, no!

37
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,724
Stop cleaning my windows!

38
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,502
I want to go to the toilet.

39
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,782
I don't know what you're saying.

40
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,982
I did the window there and the...

41
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:04,806
Yes, yes. Okey-dokey. I can't
understand what you're saying.

42
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:06,462
Can I leave my bike
for a few minutes?

43
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,933
Okay, then. All right, bye-bye.

44
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,478
What are you doing?

45
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,472
Why are you bringing the bike inside?

46
00:03:15,714 --> 00:03:18,798
What? No! Where are you going?!

47
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,503
Where are you going?

48
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,268
Why do I have your bike?

49
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:28,082
And, then, when he leaves, he just
leaves all of his stuff in my flat.

50
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,565
– What stuff?
– All his window cleaning bollocks,

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,846
the ladder, bike, everything.
It's still there!

52
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:36,006
– What, in your flat?
– Yeah. He never came back.

53
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:37,761
How did he even get in?

54
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,573
Well, he was very persuasive.

55
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,416
I think.

56
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,003
Well, I don't know
how to get in touch with this guy.

57
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:49,026
His stuff is cluttering up my hallway.
I've had to start putting these up.

58
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:54,022
My mum always says,
you should never open the door.

59
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,214
What do you mean?

60
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,158
An unopened door
is a happy door.

61
00:03:58,183 --> 00:04:00,742
So, we never answer ours
when someone knocks.

62
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,582
What, so you all just sit there?

63
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:03,597
Yes.

64
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,982
So, the doorbell goes
and you all just sit there...

65
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:09,062
until the person goes away?

66
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,198
Yes.

67
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,342
What if it's important?
What if it's good news?

68
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,862
This is London, Jen.
It's not someone with cake!

69
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:18,089
Unless that cake is made
of dog poo and knives!

70
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:23,267
Laters. I'm going to zone out at
the heads of department meeting.

71
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,878
I thought you were
trying to avoid those.

72
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:28,597
There's only so many times I can
say there's a RAM emergency.

73
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,037
Hello?

74
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:42,606
Yes?

75
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,342
Hello. Can I come in?

76
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,180
– Why?
– What?

77
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,100
Why do you want to come in?

78
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,142
Isn't this the heads
of department meeting?

79
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,262
Every Monday and Friday?
Or has it changed?

80
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,702
No, no, yes, it is. You've
missed a few though, haven't you?

81
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,942
Yeah, there was a RAM emergency.

82
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:00,782
The office had too much RAM.

83
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,902
Okay, well you see the nature of
the meetings has changed somewhat

84
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,182
and it wouldn't be fair on you.
There'd be a lot of catching up.

85
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,542
Okay!

86
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:10,196
Okay! Thanks, Jen!

87
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,563
They don't want me.

88
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,363
They don't want me
at the Monday-Friday!

89
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,742
I thought you hated
those meetings?

90
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,862
I did hate those meetings until they
didn't want me at those meetings.

91
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,914
And now I love those meetings.

92
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:36,329
– Five minutes, Mr Moss.
– Thanks, Phil.

93
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,752
A fan of tiny biscuits.

94
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,430
You are full of surprises.

95
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:52,775
Please, don't let me stop you.

96
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:55,188
I like a man with appetite.

97
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,382
It's what got you this far.

98
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,742
Sorry, do I know you?

99
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,086
They call me Prime.

100
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,582
I had another name, once.

101
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:07,188
I no longer go by it. Harold Tong.

102
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:10,982
That's right.

103
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:13,342
I won year 16 of Countdown.

104
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:17,346
Yes, it was I who won
the 16th Countdown teapot.

105
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:19,902
The teapot we all crave.

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,862
You crave it too.

107
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,234
Your eyes betray you.

108
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:29,688
He has spirit, this one.

109
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:35,477
But do you have the spirit to become
an ultimate champion, I wonder?

110
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,102
Do you want to get a photo
together or something?

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,831
I came only to give you this.

112
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:50,172
What is it?

113
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:57,107
Roy?

114
00:06:58,157 --> 00:07:00,235
Jesus! Alistair, hey!

115
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:03,329
– Long time no see!
– Yeah!

116
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:05,782
Roy and I were at college together.

117
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,782
Yeah.
Wow, you are looking great!

118
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,977
Thanks.

119
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:16,822
So what are you up to these days?

120
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:18,662
What am I up to?
Wow. Big question.

121
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,602
I'm the head writer
for Shotgun games?

122
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:25,157
– Do you know them?
– Yeah! Wow! Really?

123
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,582
I play Shotgun games all the time.
They're brilliant.

124
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,382
Thank you.

125
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:32,142
Wow, that is so cool.
Hey, you just won an award, right?

126
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,516
Yes.

127
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,102
Well, see you soon, Roy.

128
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,648
Yes.

129
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,704
Don't ask me what I'm doing,
you arrogant twat.

130
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:04,222
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'm in the right place.

131
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,309
You're in the right place, Mr Moss.
Welcome to Eight Plus.

132
00:08:24,427 --> 00:08:27,102
You came! I'm glad.

133
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,342
That's Roger Black.
That's Steven Pawlin.

134
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:32,102
You know your ex-Countdown winners.

135
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,142
Why are they all here?

136
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,502
Why, for someone who knows how to
add and subtract and multiply

137
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:39,182
and divide lots of numbers
to get one other number,

138
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:42,582
you're not so good at putting
two and two together, are you?

139
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,062
This is Eight Plus!

140
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,502
An exclusive club
for those gifted few

141
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:50,702
who make it through
to eight episodes of Countdown.

142
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:53,582
And you are our newest member.

143
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,110
Isn't that nice?

144
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,391
Thanks for letting me know.
All right. All right. Bye.

145
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:05,762
Does it not outrage you, Roy,
as a member of this IT department,

146
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,982
that I, your head, is not being
represented at the Monday-Friday?

147
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:12,702
Couldn't give a shit.
My neighbour just called.

148
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:18,008
Turns out that window-washing Willie
from West Gibberish is not now going

149
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:21,622
to be able to pick up his
window cleaning bric-a-brac.

150
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:22,631
Why not?

151
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:25,542
He was hit by a car or something.
Just my luck!

152
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:28,382
You shouldn't have agreed
to mind it for him in the first place.

153
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:31,024
Thanks, Jen. That's really helpful.
That's really good advice.

154
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,200
That's exactly what I'll do.
In the past!

155
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:36,936
When it happens again, last week.
I have to give it back to him!

156
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,102
It can't just live in my hallway!

157
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,079
Don't give a shit!

158
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,954
No, no.

159
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,493
No! No! No!

160
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:21,282
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner!

161
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:24,493
I'm not...

162
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:25,946
Alistair!

163
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,201
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner.

164
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:36,182
I'm not a window cleaner! Alistair!

165
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,133
I'm not a window cleaner!

166
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:48,302
All right, something weird
is going on in that room.

167
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,102
They're wearing dressing gowns.

168
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,102
Roy, will you listen to me?

169
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:55,102
I don't have to listen to you.
I'm not married to you.

170
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,622
I've got a lot on my mind
right now, Jen.

171
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,742
This bloke thinks
I'm a window cleaner.

172
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,902
Bloke I went to college with.

173
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:04,102
He's doing amazingly.
The creature he was with.

174
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:07,211
And he thinks that
I am a window cleaner.

175
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,803
A window cleaner!

176
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,182
What's wrong with that?
It's a noble profession.

177
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:14,063
If your last profession
was cleaning balls!

178
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,662
Google him.

179
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:19,302
I've tried.
He has no online presence.

180
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,222
Apparently, people were being rude to
him so he suspended all his accounts.

181
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,418
He's not on Friendface,
he's not on Chitter.

182
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:26,382
Listen...

183
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,142
How do people expect you
to track them down

184
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,142
if they maintain
no online presence!?

185
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,844
You've both asked
and answered that question.

186
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:33,126
What's going on
up there?

187
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,502
Is this meeting room five?

188
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,782
You know, they soundproofed that
a few weeks ago?

189
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,422
Really? What's that all about?

190
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,262
Douglas said it was for
super secret meetings.

191
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:43,542
But I want to go to
super secret meetings.

192
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:46,222
I can't believe I might be
missing super secret meetings.

193
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,822
But the dressing gowns.
Why are they wearing dressing gowns?

194
00:11:48,831 --> 00:11:50,022
Orgies!

195
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:50,902
No.

196
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,462
Maybe they're getting some kind of
executive massage treatment

197
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:55,662
for being brilliant.

198
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,302
Do you think they're
getting massages?

199
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,222
If they're getting massages, I think
my human rights are being abused

200
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:01,462
by them not letting me in.

201
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,022
Why don't you wear a towel,
hang around the door,

202
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,302
and see if they let you in?

203
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,222
I have my dignity, thank you, Moss.

204
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,418
No. Hang on, that might just work!

205
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:23,635
I can't believe you've joined
a swanky club. It's so showbizzy!

206
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,972
Roy, the people here
see me in a certain way.

207
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:29,816
It's perhaps not the way
I've been seen outside of the club.

208
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:33,472
I'd just like you not to,
you know, mention it in any way...

209
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,090
You know.

210
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:37,074
Sure. Yeah.

211
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:38,410
No problem.

212
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:08,277
Hello, Terence. Glass of milk.
Straight up. Prime?

213
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:09,933
Ribena for me.

214
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,349
Roy?

215
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,410
I'll have a beer. Thank you.

216
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,436
Alcohol-free beer, surely?

217
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:20,844
No.

218
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:22,698
– Get him what he wants.
– But...

219
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,594
Just get him what he wants.

220
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,949
I'll have to go out.
Can somebody mind the bar?

221
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,457
No. You know what? It's fine.
I shouldn't really be drinking

222
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:33,840
during lunch. I'll just
have a coke. It's fine.

223
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,651
Will I see you tonight?

224
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:42,472
Not now, Ivana.

225
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,589
Did you have sex with that lady?

226
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:54,039
If you call that mindless
animalistic rutting sex, then yes,

227
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,527
I suppose we did.

228
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,592
That sounds like sex!

229
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:02,277
Countdown Groupies are the most
sexually voracious of all groupies,

230
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,097
and the most beautiful.

231
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:07,509
I hear someone likes drinking beer.

232
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,926
This is a private booth,
Negative One.

233
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,801
Is that a name?!

234
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:17,097
This is a private club, Word.

235
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,235
Word! True dat!

236
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:21,824
True dat, innit.

237
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:25,246
My name is Word here.

238
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,621
Roy, please.

239
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,543
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Negative One.

240
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:35,394
Heard you been catching
some nice letters.

241
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,801
I get the same letters
as everyone else.

242
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:41,059
Good when they fall
in the right order, though, innit?

243
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,480
Steady, gentlemen.

244
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,683
Boom!

245
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:50,266
Don't mind him. Negative One
was quite proud of being

246
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,144
our best speller
until Moss came along.

247
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,238
Our drinks.

248
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,738
Can I just say...

249
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,020
I am having a great time!

250
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,675
Hey, y'all. Turn the music off.

251
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:12,410
Turn the music off!

252
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:15,222
What's he up to?

253
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:21,840
Maybe our new champion would like
to test his skills out on the street.

254
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,980
He's challenging you to a game
of Street Countdown.

255
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,560
You cannot accept.
It's too dangerous!

256
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:32,176
Well, what do you say?

257
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,152
Or is you worried
you is going to show yourself up

258
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:37,168
in front of your girlfriend?

259
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,621
He's calling Roy your girlfriend.

260
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:43,641
Within the walls of Eight Plus,
that's a definite diss.

261
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:48,992
You're lucky my «girlfriend»
has gone to the toilet.

262
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,808
Is you going to answer me
or what?

263
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,402
No! We promised
those days were over.

264
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:58,222
No more unlicensed
Street Countdown battles!

265
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,919
I didn't arks you.

266
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,261
I arksed him.

267
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,605
Well?

268
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:09,980
What is Street Countdown?

269
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:11,683
It's more or less the same
as normal Countdown,

270
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,789
except we play it
on the street.

271
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:17,251
That doesn't sound that dangerous.

272
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:19,019
It can get quite cold.

273
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,841
I always wear thermals.

274
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:22,730
Then you're probably fine.

275
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:26,009
Hey, I is still standing here.

276
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,195
What do you say, newbie?

277
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:31,824
I came here
to drink milk and kick ass.

278
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,488
And I've just finished my milk.

279
00:16:40,148 --> 00:16:44,143
Welcome to Street Countdown!

280
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,988
First rule of Street Countdown

281
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:58,596
is that you really must try and tell
as many people as possible about it.

282
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:02,212
It's a rather fun game and the more
people we tell about it the better.

283
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,027
What the...?

284
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,824
Where is everyone?
Hello?

285
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,393
Hello? Moss?

286
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:19,629
Ivana?

287
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,618
Hello?

288
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,735
Hello in there!

289
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,095
For f...!

290
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,855
Hey! Hey mate! Mate!

291
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,626
Could you do me a favour?

292
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:02,431
So, do you just do big windows,
or do you do call outs?

293
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,798
What, did you think I would
come round and do your house?

294
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:08,818
No. No. Didn't think that.

295
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,545
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

296
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:16,742
Hey!

297
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,774
Alistair! Alistair!

298
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,243
It's me!

299
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,642
Alistair!

300
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:26,337
I'm not a window cleaner!

301
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:28,963
Hello?

302
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,251
I'm not a window cleaner!

303
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:34,243
I've got to go.

304
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,095
I'm...

305
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,892
I'm not a window cleaner!

306
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,228
That bloke! He thinks
I'm a bloody window cleaner!

307
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,681
Not that there's...

308
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:53,181
It's a noble profession.

309
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,665
Is this as fast as this goes? Yeah.

310
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,188
Consonant.

311
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:22,032
Vowel.

312
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,904
Vowel. Boom!

313
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,475
I'll take a further consonant.

314
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:31,024
Consonant, you get me?

315
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:33,915
I'll take a vowel this time.

316
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,774
I'll have what he's having. Vowel.

317
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,767
I'll have another consonant.

318
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:44,376
Give me one of dem sweet,
sweet consonants, you get me?

319
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:48,071
I'll take a consonant,
plain and simple, thank you.

320
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,118
I'll take an even sweeter vowel.

321
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,407
I'll take a regular vowel, please.

322
00:19:56,938 --> 00:19:57,938
Yeah, I think...

323
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,321
I think that's probably
enough letters, yeah?

324
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:02,845
18 letters.

325
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,767
I've never seen so many!

326
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,371
He is the one.

327
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,212
What happened to you?!

328
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:13,075
This is the longest word
yet on Street Countdown.

329
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,032
Unlike normal Countdown,
you see, what happens...

330
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,157
I don't care.

331
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:24,048
Negative One?

332
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,469
12.

333
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:30,571
Moss?

334
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:32,886
16.

335
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,315
Your word, Negative One?

336
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,313
Enormousness.

337
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:43,868
I shall give my answer, if I may,
in the form of a joke.

338
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,835
This is most irregular.

339
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:51,839
What do you call Negative One
sitting alone in an empty room?

340
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,157
I don't know.
What do you call Negative One

341
00:20:54,182 --> 00:20:55,933
sitting alone in an empty room?

342
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,181
Overnumerousness!

343
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:00,995
Gyles?

344
00:21:01,004 --> 00:21:04,157
Yes, that is a word!
And the joke does make sense.

345
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,033
Okay, let's go!

346
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:34,724
Yes!

347
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:36,100
Shit.

348
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:39,475
Five, six, seven...
Jen, you've joined us.

349
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:41,049
Yes, yes, I have!

350
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,592
You're not really dressed for it.

351
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:45,360
Thought I'd wear normal clothes
and work up a real sweat.

352
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:48,259
Hardcore. There's me thinking
you didn't have it in you.

353
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:50,454
Right, now let's take it to the max.

354
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,813
Five, six, seven, eight.

355
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,407
Hey! Hey, Alistair!

356
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:47,143
God, I can't believe I got you!

357
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,538
How you doing?

358
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,420
Yeah, no, it's Roy. Yeah, hello.

359
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:55,147
Listen, Alistair, I just wanted
to say, I'm not a window cleaner.

360
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,374
No, no, I work in IT.

361
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:01,444
Yeah, yeah,
with computers and all that.

362
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:02,944
Macs?

363
00:23:03,478 --> 00:23:05,670
No, I really just
work with Windows.

364
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:08,762
Hello?
