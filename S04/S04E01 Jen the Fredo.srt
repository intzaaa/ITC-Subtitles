1
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:26,913
«The IT Crowd»:
season 4, episode 1

2
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,867
Jen, have a listen to this.

3
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,791
Moss, have you
seen the newsletter?

4
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,802
Does this sound mysterious?

5
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:41,226
Yeah, yeah, it's quite mysterious.

6
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,866
I was hoping for ruddy mysterious.

7
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,026
It's fairly mysterious.

8
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:50,026
Compiling a playlist for
a role-playing game I'm hosting.

9
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,930
Important to get the right atmos.

10
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,954
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about.

11
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,026
Kind of a Dungeons and Dragons thing.

12
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,986
Is this something to do with sex?

13
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,506
Far from it, Jen.

14
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:02,706
No, you see, in role-playing,
one person is a dungeon master,

15
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,106
or game master, or keeper.

16
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,546
He or she controls the world

17
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:07,703
and tells the players
what they're experiencing,

18
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,641
whether battling a coal monster,

19
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,985
or just kicking back in a smelly old
tavern with some roguish elves.

20
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,426
Played over a few hours,

21
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:17,466
it uses dice rolls to determine
the outcome of events.

22
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:20,106
Unlike most board games
you might be familiar with,

23
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:22,426
role-playing games often
use a 20-sided dice.

24
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:23,306
– Moss?
– Yeah.

25
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:24,346
I want to stop listening to this.

26
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:26,175
I completely understand.

27
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:30,183
So, in the world
we actually live in,

28
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:34,586
a post has opened up
for Entertainments Manager.

29
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:38,586
I could do that. That sounds great.
Better than whatever this job is.

30
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:41,266
Entertainments Manager.

31
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,112
It's not for you, Jen.

32
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,946
What? Organising cultural events

33
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,706
for visiting business partners,
that is so me.

34
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:52,586
It's not though.
It's really not for you.

35
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:54,346
What am I talking to you for?
Where's Roy?

36
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,466
Not in yet.

37
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,986
Is he still moping about
after that girl?

38
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,986
Worse than ever.
Thank God he can't play guitar.

39
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,426
Have you seen the pictures?

40
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,586
Pictures?
There's more than one of these?

41
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:05,946
Yeah, there's a buttload.

42
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,906
And she's Photoshopped
out of all of them.

43
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:12,039
Yeah, it's like someone
broke up with Stalin.

44
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,781
It's such a shame.

45
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:24,946
I've never seen him happier
than the last few months. And now...

46
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:27,085
– Hi, Roy!
– Hi, Roy/

47
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:30,026
It's okay, you're obviously
talking about me.

48
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:31,679
– No, no...
– It's fine.

49
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,804
I realise I haven't been the
easiest person to be around

50
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,179
the last few weeks.

51
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,857
But I really feel like
I've turned the corner now.

52
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:39,882
I really do.

53
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:42,426
So if we can all just
carry on as normal...

54
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,695
My God, my God!

55
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,666
I feel like I've come out
the other side of it now.

56
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,531
So, everything's going to be OK
from here on in...

57
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:52,475
My heart hurts!

58
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:55,429
You do seem better than yesterday.

59
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,646
But Roy, you've got
to snap out of this.

60
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,486
I know, I know.

61
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:02,866
Some things just don't work out.

62
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,986
I know you're not used to being
in a long-term relationship.

63
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,351
It's really rare for me.

64
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:10,092
It's so rare.

65
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,226
But take it from me,
most of them just don't work out.

66
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,859
She's right, Roy.

67
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,026
And how would you know?

68
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:19,986
I do all right.

69
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,306
When?

70
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:24,346
Well, if you must know,
I met a girl on holiday.

71
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:26,866
They're always on holiday,
aren't they, Moss?

72
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,929
Shut up, Dumpo,
the elephant who got dumped!

73
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:31,796
– Hey, hey!
– Well...

74
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:35,322
No, it's okay. I'm all right.

75
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:36,826
I mean, I'm still a bit...

76
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:39,106
She never said goodbye,
so, I just kind of...

77
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:43,106
It still just hurts just a little bit
whenever I think about her.

78
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:47,106
So. I guess all I have to do is just
never think about her. Simples!

79
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,929
She used to love that ad.

80
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,786
It's not for you, Jen.

81
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,626
What, why not?

82
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,546
Entertainments Manager?
Do you know what that involves?

83
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:08,226
From what I can gather
it's organising cultural events

84
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,866
for out-of-town business partners.

85
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,626
That's right. Yes, yes.

86
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,466
It's not for you.

87
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,210
But as fas as I can see,
it won't interfere

88
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:16,883
with my duties
in the IT department.

89
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:20,906
And I love culture. I've seen
We Will Rock You four times.

90
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,386
Well, Jen, I'd love to help you,

91
00:04:26,387 --> 00:04:29,266
but traditionally the role
of Entertainments Manager

92
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,038
has always been held by a man.

93
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,107
Mr. Reynholm,
I don't need to remind you

94
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,266
of the report that denounced
Reynholm Industries

95
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,626
as an institutionally sexist
organisation.

96
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,382
Now, you hold on a minute,
sugar tits!

97
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,030
Everyone saw through that report.

98
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:48,466
I even got that award
off those feminists.

99
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,757
The one shaped like
the ice-cream fellow.

100
00:04:52,902 --> 00:04:55,038
That's a «Shithead of The Year» award.

101
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:02,586
It actually says it on the base
«Shithead of The Year».

102
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:05,437
Did you not read the base?

103
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,617
– God!
– Women!

104
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,194
What are they? Who knows?

105
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:33,378
Don't do this.

106
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:38,010
Can't live with them,
can't find them sometimes.

107
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,306
What's going on
in their little heads?

108
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:45,306
Don't ask me, I'm not a flippin'
women psychiatrist.

109
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:50,646
But I have learned one or two things
from conversations with my mother.

110
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:53,346
No, no, Moss, please,

111
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:55,986
don't go any further,
just stop right there.

112
00:05:55,987 --> 00:05:59,746
You're no good at this kind of thing,
Moss, you'll just make it worse.

113
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,306
Sorry, it's just
I've never seen you like this.

114
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,946
I know. But I'll be fine.

115
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,466
I will. It's just...
You can't help with this.

116
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,626
You just can't.

117
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:10,066
I've got it. I've got the job.

118
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:10,786
What?

119
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,346
Douglas gave me the job
so I'd stop talking.

120
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,812
Jen's Entertainments Manager.

121
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:22,335
It's not for you, Jen.

122
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,906
Why does everyone keep saying that?

123
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:25,826
What happened to Gerry?

124
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,106
Massive heart attack.

125
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,386
I'm not surprised.

126
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,626
Why are you not surprised?
Why is it not for me?

127
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:34,426
Gerry was the... He was the
company Fredo. You're the new Fredo.

128
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,866
I don't know what
you're talking about.

129
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,746
Fredo, from the Godfather.

130
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,426
Who's Fredo again?
Who's he in it?

131
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:43,266
He's the brother, whose job it is to
take out-of-town businessmen and...

132
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,306
Show them a good time, yeah,
that's what I have to do.

133
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,026
I was thinking West End show...

134
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:49,484
No, no, Jen, I don't think
you understand.

135
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,117
These men are going to expect
a lot more than a West End show.

136
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,656
Fredo, Jen, he was...

137
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,962
He was sort of a pimp.

138
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:00,986
Shut up.

139
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,687
– Wasn't he, Moss?
– What?

140
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,706
Fredo, in the film,
he was essentially a pimp.

141
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,390
No, he took the ring to Mordor.

142
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:17,142
Fredo was a pimp.

143
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:20,026
No, no, that film was the '70s.

144
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,746
Things are different now.

145
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:23,986
Businessmen are different.

146
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:30,413
Anyway, enough about our balls.

147
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,976
Gentleman, I'd like you to meet Jen.

148
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:44,532
No, no, no, Jen's
our new Entertainments Manager.

149
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:47,116
But she's a woman, isn't she?

150
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,140
Jen, I'd like you to meet
an old friend of mine, Phil.

151
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,281
And two men named John.

152
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,146
What are you up to, Reynholm?

153
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,426
Don't you worry, Phil.

154
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:00,466
Jen may look like an old maid
holding pennies in her arse,

155
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:02,296
but she knows the sleaziest routes

156
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:05,040
round this old town
I like to call Londinius.

157
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:09,546
And I'm sure she's planned something
suitably raucous for you reprobates.

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,226
Yes, yes, I have tickets for
a wonderful show in the West End.

159
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:16,266
As long as it
doesn't have subtitles.

160
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,186
Subtitles, no.

161
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,765
What's got subtitles?!

162
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,273
– This thing she's bringing us to.
– Subtitles? God!

163
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,326
I can't read while I'm also
trying to see things.

164
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:28,426
No, no, it's a show, it's a show.
There's no subtitles.

165
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,066
I hate subtitles.

166
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,346
What happened to Gerry?

167
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:32,746
His heart exploded.

168
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:35,191
Brilliant!

169
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,735
No, he's quite seriously ill.

170
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,199
That's classic Gerry.

171
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:44,320
Gerry wouldn't have brought us
to something with subtitles.

172
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,508
There's no subtitles, it's a show.

173
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,332
Come on, Jen, what type of show?

174
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:52,702
Well, yes, well it's very raunchy.

175
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:55,040
Yes, I don't think
you'll be disappointed.

176
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,186
Women in it?

177
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,506
Yes, it's an all-woman show.

178
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,906
It's very rude.

179
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,386
An all-woman show?

180
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:02,506
And it's rude.

181
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,554
Eiffel Tower!

182
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,266
I'm so sorry,
I really can't apologise enough.

183
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,506
I've never been
so embarrassed in my life.

184
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:19,812
That woman was in EastEnders,
how dare you humiliate her?!

185
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:21,835
It's not our fault
you took us to something

186
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,452
called The Vagina Monologues.

187
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:26,036
You get there,
and it's just women talking.

188
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,707
False advertising.

189
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:29,826
Look, we're in town
for five more days.

190
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:32,226
You better have something
proper for us to do.

191
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:35,386
Next time you take us to something
about talking fannies,

192
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:38,413
it better be about talking fannies.

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,539
I know you had good reasons
for giving me this award.

194
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,563
I should never have done
that interview.

195
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:50,630
But that journalist had an agenda.

196
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:53,294
There's more.
«Women are a kind of savage animal,

197
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,798
who men have civilised
with their insatiable sexuality».

198
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,200
What don't you like about that?

199
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:04,739
«Women are essentially
no different from radiators».

200
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:09,546
«I like my women
like I like my toast, hot...»

201
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:11,825
And consumable with butter.

202
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,083
You don't have to remind me.

203
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:17,747
I'm all too familiar
with my misguided words.

204
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:21,840
Ladies, listen,
no-one can mistake me for Gok Wan.

205
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:26,853
I've an old-fashioned mindset,
but damn it, at least I try.

206
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,306
And Reynholm Industries is changing,
ladies, for the better.

207
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:33,266
The glass ceiling
is now a glass floor.

208
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,306
The women are floating above it,

209
00:10:35,307 --> 00:10:37,536
and the men are just
looking up at them.

210
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,153
So, what do you want from us?

211
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:45,857
What?

212
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,848
Please take that award back
and give it to somebody else.

213
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:52,952
Mr. Reynholm, I really need
to talk to you about something.

214
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:55,947
Jen, I'd like you to meet
some very special woman.

215
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,161
– No, no, no!
– What?

216
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,745
Mr. Reynholm, I will not
work with prostitutes.

217
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,817
No, no, no, these are feminists.

218
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,561
You can dress it up
however you like,

219
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:09,505
they still sleep with men for money.

220
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,473
I'm sorry, no offence.

221
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,145
But I don't charge
for these potatoes.

222
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,098
And I don't like women who do.

223
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:22,388
Don't listen to her!
The bitch is crazy.

224
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:30,186
Douglas wants me
to see out the week.

225
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:34,146
A whole week in the
company of those idiots.

226
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:36,346
Culture's out, restaurants are out.

227
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,520
God, this is a nightmare.

228
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:46,325
Men!

229
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,706
What are they like? With their
bawdy talk and rough-housing,

230
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:55,614
and their wandering hands,
and breath in the morning.

231
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,386
I'd like to see them
have the babies.

232
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:00,786
What are you getting at, Moss?

233
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,826
Well, unless I'm very much mistaken,

234
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:06,826
this seems to be a problem for
which you need the male perspective.

235
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,306
Do you know any men?

236
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:20,306
You want a good time, right?
One that walks on the wild side

237
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,466
without compromising
your principles?

238
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,426
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

239
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,786
Then you got it, baby!

240
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,786
...which is why the game needs
a 20-sided dice.

241
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,152
I've not understood a word
you've just said.

242
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:39,559
What is it?
Some sort of computer game?

243
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,792
In a sense, except it uses the
most powerful processor known to man.

244
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:45,661
The human mind.

245
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:48,512
But you're not playing.

246
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,352
I'm not a player.
But I am playing.

247
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:56,592
He sort of tells us
what's happening.

248
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,312
I will be your guide.

249
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:01,792
Through my words, you will
experience the land of Elfenheart.

250
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:05,392
From the mighty mountains that
border the Goblin Wastelands.

251
00:13:05,393 --> 00:13:09,392
To the sewers that run like a spider
web through the city of Jandor.

252
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,152
I, gentlemen, will be your eyes.

253
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,168
I will be everyone you meet.

254
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:27,114
Every creature you encounter,
every trap you spring.

255
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,181
What about him?

256
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,543
What's this business with the face
like a slapped arse?

257
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,059
I'm sorry, I just came out of
a long-term relationship, so...

258
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,088
It doesn't...
She was the greatest woman

259
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,432
I've ever met and I'm never
going to see her again.

260
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,232
But it's fine, I mean,
she never said goodbye.

261
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,992
I'm not going
to bore you with it.

262
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,934
See that you bloody don't!

263
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,392
I still don't understand
what this game is!

264
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:53,112
It seems gay.

265
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,348
Are dragons gay, Phil?

266
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,837
Mighty warrior priests wielding

267
00:13:57,862 --> 00:14:00,762
golden staffs.
I suppose they're gay too?

268
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,192
Here are your character sheets.

269
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:06,752
John One, you're a unicorn man.

270
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:09,129
John Two, you're a wood fairy.

271
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:14,904
And Phil, you're
the Gypsy assassin, Esmerelda.

272
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,169
I'm a woman?

273
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,981
I don't think I want to be a woman.

274
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:24,232
Just go with it.

275
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:25,614
It will end.

276
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:30,072
So, gentlemen, are you prepared
to open the doors to your mind

277
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,792
and travel to worlds
hitherto undreamed of?

278
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,379
Look at those fun bags.

279
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,152
Everybody doing okay, yeah?

280
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,614
You good for drinks?

281
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:50,582
Loosen up.
It's a role-playing party.

282
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,206
Jen, can I have a word?

283
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,372
I don't think I want
to hang with these guys.

284
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:58,912
Come on, Phil!

285
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:00,887
These guys are the best.

286
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,152
They're going to do things
tonight, that'll blow your mind.

287
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,018
Really?

288
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:08,312
Look at them.
They're young, they're keen.

289
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:10,317
And all they want to do
is show you a good time.

290
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,715
So get back there before
you hurt their feelings.

291
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:18,707
Could I steal
the lovely Roy for a sec?

292
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,372
It's just him in all of these.

293
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,952
Thanks, Jen, that was
all getting a little bit...

294
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:33,050
– What do you think you're doing?
– What?

295
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,137
Bringing everyone
down with your private life.

296
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:37,135
They don't want to know about
your miserable private life.

297
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,747
They're here for a good time.
Look at that face.

298
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,223
Who'd want to
role-play with that face?

299
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:46,972
I'm sorry Jen... I just...
I'm not feeling it tonight.

300
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:51,597
Then fake it, sweetheart, yeah?

301
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,672
We're getting good money for this.

302
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,150
Don't you want to get
the deposit for a flat,

303
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:00,340
leave those bad memories behind?

304
00:16:00,481 --> 00:16:01,481
– Yeah.
– Yeah?

305
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,965
– I'll try harder, Jen.
– Okay.

306
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,520
Good girl.

307
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,872
Get back there and show
those Johns a good time.

308
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:19,132
Well, that cleaned the pipes.

309
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:22,162
I've got to thank you, Miranda,
for giving me a second chance.

310
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,552
Don't mention it. Although you
do know I don't have the authority

311
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:27,432
to take back the award myself?

312
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:29,223
What?

313
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:34,352
No, we all make mistakes.
And you intrigue me.

314
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,291
Something tells me there's
more to you than meets the eye.

315
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:41,377
Do you mean the rumours
that I killed my wife?

316
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,966
No. Are there rumours?

317
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:47,030
No.

318
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:51,082
There were rumours that there was a
rumour, but that was just bullshit.

319
00:16:52,473 --> 00:16:55,872
I didn't like the way the nominations
came from inside your company.

320
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,426
Inside my company?

321
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,930
Yeah, one of the women from
the IT department faxed a dossier

322
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:01,874
of your behaviour over
the last 12 months.

323
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:05,390
One of the women
in the IT department?

324
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,072
Oh, sorry, Phil.

325
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,710
Heal All is probably the worst spell
you could have used.

326
00:17:11,735 --> 00:17:13,578
The sound of your low-level magic

327
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:15,409
attracts the attention
of the palace guards.

328
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,703
Damn it!

329
00:17:17,163 --> 00:17:18,937
One comes through the door.

330
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:20,121
Throwing knife.

331
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,608
Are you sure?
Quite a low damage.

332
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,078
I have a plus 40%
chance of a critical.

333
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:27,142
Remember the talking bunny that
gave me that magic bracelet?

334
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,999
Yeah, that bunny thing
gave him that thing.

335
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,117
You're absolutely right. Roll 'em.

336
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,632
– Yes!
– Yes!

337
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,578
Direct hit.
The knife cleaves his head in twain

338
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:44,112
and some of his brains runneth
down John Two's invisibility cloak.

339
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,124
Eiffel Tower!

340
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,752
Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.

341
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:51,952
Dammit!

342
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:55,226
'Tis the dreaded Imperial Guard,
the cruellest of all

343
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:56,789
of Queen Elisa's troops.

344
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:00,460
At their head
someone you recognise.

345
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:05,171
Well, well, well.

346
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:09,112
If it isn't the adventurers who
have been causing me all this bother.

347
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:10,912
Lucius Santana!

348
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,562
The very same.

349
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:16,552
Stand your men down, Lucius!
We have no quarrel with you!

350
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,952
Quarrel? I just came to see how a
mismatched bunch of raggle taggle

351
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,632
adventurers bested some of the
deadliest criminals in Crackenwood.

352
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,812
That's us!

353
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,531
You have my thanks.
And if you ever want to join

354
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:34,115
the Palace Guard,
you know where I am.

355
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,859
The Palace Guard?

356
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,312
You have my sword.

357
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:40,832
And my staff.

358
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,437
And my bunny bracelet.

359
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,663
And whatever it is that I have.

360
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,072
The mist clears.

361
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,781
You see alone, female figure.

362
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,312
That's ruddy mysterious.

363
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:06,593
Hello, Darkharden.

364
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,546
Hello.

365
00:19:09,393 --> 00:19:11,272
Who goes there?

366
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,351
It is I, Queen Elisa Eldridge
of the Elves,

367
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:17,460
who cruelly jilted you
not three moons ago.

368
00:19:27,953 --> 00:19:29,416
Don't do this.

369
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,620
Just go with it, Roy.

370
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:40,010
Hello, my queen.

371
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,072
How are you?

372
00:19:44,073 --> 00:19:45,549
I'm fine.

373
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:48,737
You look well.

374
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:51,472
So do you... Does she?

375
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,135
– Yes, she does, actually.
– Does she?

376
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:57,010
So, what are you up to?

377
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,432
You know just...

378
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,838
Just keeping busy.

379
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,034
Missing you a little bit.

380
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,152
Yourself?

381
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,526
Usual boring pageantry.

382
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:12,784
You know how the people of
Pippsiehollow love a parade.

383
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,792
What are you doing here?

384
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:19,210
Sorry.

385
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:25,260
Sorry. Bear with me.
Bear with me. Bear with me.

386
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:33,307
I sense a sadness in you.

387
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,893
It's just hard.

388
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:44,666
You know?

389
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,940
I miss you.

390
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,768
I can still smell you on our pillow.

391
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:57,752
When I close my eyes,

392
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:00,291
it's still your face I see.

393
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:06,971
It's just hard.

394
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:11,143
You were here
and then you were gone.

395
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,979
What do you want?

396
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:19,352
It was not easy for me
to come here, Darkharden.

397
00:21:19,673 --> 00:21:23,672
But I had one thing
I felt I needed to say to you.

398
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,132
Goodbye.

399
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,472
Goodbye.

400
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:03,581
Brilliant night! Brilliant!

401
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:07,198
I can't believe I've never tried
role-playing games before.

402
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:10,393
I'm going to go home and tell
the whole rugby club about it.

403
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:14,072
Roy and Moss did not disappoint?

404
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:16,002
They did not.
I'd like to see them again.

405
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,272
Thank you, Douglas.

406
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:21,221
That's one special little
lady you've got there.

407
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:23,643
I'm glad Jerry died.

408
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,112
Eiffel Tower!

409
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,872
Eiffel Tower! Eiffel Tower!

410
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,651
– Eiffel Tower!
– Eiffel Tower!

411
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:35,776
Before you go, Jen,
I know it was you.

412
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:40,776
You broke my heart.
You broke my heart!

413
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:48,072
That's right.
That's right!

414
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,152
Shut up!

415
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:50,712
You've cheered up.

416
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:53,672
Yeah, I'm feeling
a lot better now, Jen, thanks.

417
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:56,432
Thanks to a certain Elfin queen.

418
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:02,474
What happened to Fredo, in the film?

419
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,338
The Godfather has him killed.

420
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:10,832
I'm going to go home.

421
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,596
I'm not feeling too good.

422
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,575
Problem solved!
