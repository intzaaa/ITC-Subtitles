1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,535
You there!

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,293
Blind, wizened man.

3
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:24,197
I have come from a faraway place
to seek a great sorcerer.

4
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:27,247
– I am whom you seek.
– You?

5
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:33,188
You're nothing but an old man in a tent
in rags playing hoopaloo with the wind.

6
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:36,314
– You wish for proof?
– Aye!

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,453
Pick a card.

8
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:42,010
Don't tell me!

9
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:43,969
Put it back in the pack.

10
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,086
Is it your card?

11
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,931
No, but damn close.
You are the man I seek.

12
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:56,195
Come, sit. Tell me a tale.

13
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:58,035
It's a woman.

14
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:00,725
It is always a woman.

15
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:04,797
Her sweet voice wakes a mighty tiger
behind my fly.

16
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:07,659
Yet she is proud and will not have me.

17
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,652
Her name is Jane or Jan
or something similar.

18
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:15,485
– You would have her to your bed?
– Aye. A thousand times, aye.

19
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,980
Take this, tinc... tinc...

20
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,899
tincture, and put it in her drink.

21
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:24,912
She'll be yours within moments!

22
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,946
Thank you. I will use it well.

23
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:34,132
– What's that for?
– Sorry, it was an accident.

24
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,725
– What did you do that for?
– Like I say, it was an accident.

25
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:40,578
– It was full of coins!
– All right! I've apologised once.

26
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:44,224
– That was a stupid thing to do!
– You could have caught it, you idiot!

27
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:46,874
– That was stupid!
– I've no time for this bullshit.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,648
– What level is this?
– Shut up!

29
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,405
My God!

30
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,786
– That was perfect!
– I rock!

31
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,341
Didn't miss a note.
I am wasting my life.

32
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:49,063
– I am wasting my life.
– How?

33
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,156
Why am I so good at this?
What, am I gonna put this on my CV?

34
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:56,909
– Can't something just be fun?
– Oh, no, put it away, please.

35
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,818
– But I've got a big gig coming up.
– Put it away.

36
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:02,399
– All right, Yoko.
– Oh, God.

37
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,717
Are you still in the same clothes
as yesterday?

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,892
I, may have met a lady
in the pub last night.

39
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,243
Oh, yeah?

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,621
Oh, yes,
it was quite a memorable evening.

41
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,157
Good for you.

42
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,413
Oh, Stephanie, hi.

43
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,313
Oh, God. Right, OK, yeah.

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,277
I'll send him right...
I'll be right up. Bye.

45
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,674
– Douglas again?
– Yeah.

46
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,404
He keeps bringing me up
on these flimsy pretexts.

47
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,556
The other day,
it was to show me a dead fly.

48
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,164
Fly!

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,197
Yeah, it's getting a little ridiculous.

50
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,223
You won't believe
what happened last night.

51
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:56,589
Wait till I tell you
what happened to me.

52
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,770
I bought this muffin from the canteen,

53
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,715
and I'll be Jolly Rogered
if there's not hyperoside in it.

54
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:06,881
Curium. Ebrium. And unless
I'm going crazy, that's selenium.

55
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:11,971
It's definitely hyperoside, and it's not
listed in the table of contents.

56
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:18,349
That was a great story.

57
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,859
You remember the woman from last night?

58
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,113
She seemed lovely, right?

59
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,167
– She was a delight.
– Yeah. We get outside,

60
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:31,034
there was a group of tramps,
two of whom she knows by name.

61
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,940
She starts screaming at them,

62
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:38,223
"You owe me money!" She thinks
that the tramps owe her money.

63
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,022
Next thing I know, it all kicks off.

64
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,084
I'm running for my life.
It was a horrible evening,

65
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:47,004
a horrible evening,
and she's a horrible woman.

66
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:50,524
Right... But you slept with her?

67
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,997
I've been expecting you.

68
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,285
You asked me to come up.

69
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:11,906
Which is why I've been expecting you.

70
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,150
Anyway, I'm glad we've got that
cleared up.

71
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,826
I've got a lot of important papers
to look over,

72
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,705
so if you don't mind...

73
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:22,736
What, leave?

74
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,504
Yes, please.

75
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,807
I like you, Jen.

76
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:31,192
You don't ask questions.

77
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:34,536
A lot of people'd be confused
as to why I invited them up,

78
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,879
then asked them to leave. Not you.

79
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,593
A person needs a lot of backbone
to be ordered around like that.

80
00:05:42,196 --> 00:05:44,516
You've got spunk and balls.

81
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,012
And I like that in a woman.

82
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,470
Which is why I'd like you to be my P.A.

83
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:55,931
– Really?
– Yes. Stephanie's leaving.

84
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:58,313
– Definitely?
– No, Stephanie.

85
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:00,871
Come sit on my big hand.

86
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,285
It's a huge pay rise, a chance

87
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,882
of wonderful opportunities.
you'd be crazy to pass up. Sex.

88
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:12,540
– What?
– What?

89
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,486
Did you just say sex?

90
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,730
I don't think so. Come on, Jen!

91
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:22,367
I need your mind on the job, not
thinking about sexy sex all the time.

92
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,507
It's true, I have been accused
of sexy shenanigans

93
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:28,436
against my female employees.

94
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:31,795
– Yes, there's that court case.
– Yeah, but she'll settle.

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,195
That was the old me. This is the new me.

96
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:38,220
And I want you to be a part of it.
A part of me. Sex...

97
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,989
I've got something to tell you.

98
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,606
Oh, my God!

99
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,730
– Wait 'till I tell you.
– Ah, sorry.

100
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:59,876
Where's Roy? He should be here.

101
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:01,213
Before you begin,

102
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:04,226
I should say that I have problems
processing big news.

103
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:07,821
Douglas has asked me to be his P.A.

104
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:09,678
Oh, my God!

105
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,073
His P.A.!

106
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,218
Oh... my... God!

107
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,952
That is something and a half!

108
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:21,607
His P.A.! How?

109
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:27,079
His... Shut up! His P.A.!

110
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,618
– It means Personal Assistant.
– Thank you.

111
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,100
Right. OK.
What does that actually involve?

112
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:38,488
Oh, picking up his mail,
going to the supermarket for him,

113
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:41,292
getting his washing.
I have to say, Moss,

114
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,126
it's a real step up.

115
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,972
How are you going to do that
and work here?

116
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:49,283
That's the thing.
He wants me to quit the department.

117
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:53,088
– You're not going to do it, are you?
– Well, there's a huge pay rise.

118
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:54,914
Phew. So, no?

119
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,494
– No, I probably am.
– But what about the pay rise?

120
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:00,298
– That's if I go.
– Right.

121
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:02,418
He's not paying me more to stay here.

122
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:07,023
Of course not, that'd be ridiculous.

123
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,222
So, am I getting a pay rise?

124
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,657
Why would you get a pay rise?

125
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,215
– OK, let's just start again.
– Yeah.

126
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:18,026
Douglas wants me to be your P.A.?

127
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:19,226
No!

128
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,942
– Then why am I getting a pay rise?
– Why is he getting a pay rise?

129
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,739
Jen wants me to be her P.A.

130
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:28,302
Where did you get this?
It's Douglas who wants a P. A.!

131
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:30,575
I don't want to be Douglas's P.A.

132
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:32,645
He's not really qualified, Jen.

133
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,260
Do you even have the authority
to offer me a pay rise?

134
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,963
I don't want you as a P.A.

135
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:40,860
It's Douglas who wants me
to be his P.A. That's it!

136
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,492
That's all there is!

137
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,431
You don't come into it,
you're not involved.

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,203
Who's Douglas?

139
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,608
So, Douglas wants you to be his P.A.?

140
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,504
– Yes.
– Are you gonna do it?

141
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,641
I don’t know, it's an opportunity,
you know?

142
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,566
– Yeah. You should probably do it.
– Yeah?

143
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:02,438
I mean, you don't wanna be stuck here
for the rest of your life

144
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,659
– playing Guitar Hero.
– Exactly, exactly.

145
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,764
Yeah, I think I'll say yes.
I think I have to.

146
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:12,271
You guys will probably be glad
to see the back of me.

147
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:17,623
You're gonna let that hang there.

148
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,946
No, I'm joking. Of course we won't.

149
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,790
Oh, for f... OK.

150
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:28,836
OK, could you stop shouting at me?

151
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:32,580
OK, stop shouting at me.
I told you not to call me at work.

152
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,562
How are you drunk again?
It's not even noon.

153
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:38,737
Who is this?
Yeah, yeah. This is his wife.

154
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,695
Please don't call here again.

155
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:45,512
Yep. What are you gonna do without me?

156
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:52,958
You know that list of things we're
not allowed to do when Jen's here?

157
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,508
I think it's time for a print-out.

158
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,528
Oh, my word.

159
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,733
Oh, God.

160
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,858
Oh, bloody hell!

161
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,687
This is amazing!

162
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:20,893
Get in!

163
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,469
Welcome to the 30th floor, Jen.

164
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,007
Come with me.

165
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,600
I wanna show you something.

166
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:38,239
– Two of them now!
– Yes.

167
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:42,062
Do you want me to get rid of them?

168
00:10:42,826 --> 00:10:45,917
Ten minutes in and you've
already paid for yourself.

169
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,670
So, Terry can do squash
on the Tuesday.

170
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,569
Lucinda says she can't wait.

171
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,179
And Chessington World of Adventures say

172
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,168
they're very sorry, but...
you're not allowed back.

173
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,316
Whatever.

174
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,882
How long have you been working for me
now, Jen? 3, 4 months, is it?

175
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,402
Well, no, it's just been today.

176
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,093
You're right. We went jogging,

177
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:36,848
I knackered that squirrel,

178
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,632
the hand thing happened.

179
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,599
Feels longer.

180
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:44,174
Feels like we've built up a...
connection.

181
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,690
Yes, yes, a business connection.

182
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:49,033
Yeah, yeah. More than that, though.

183
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,368
No, I don't think so.

184
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,993
Well, I feel like. Know what I mean?

185
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,927
I do and I disagree.

186
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,681
Anyway, these came back today.

187
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,463
Come on, Jen!
Ever feel like just having some fun?

188
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,283
Mr Reynholm, I am a professional.

189
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:13,682
I take my job seriously.
And if I wasn't able to do it properly,

190
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,784
I'd be letting myself and you down.

191
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:19,671
So, please, either let me do my job
or let me go.

192
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:23,278
Anyway, these came back
and they said they did

193
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,367
their best but some of the stains
just won't come out.

194
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:28,538
Good God.

195
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,807
You looked exactly like Melissa there.

196
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:34,763
Melissa?

197
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,393
My wife. She died.

198
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:40,516
Oh, poor you. That's terrible.

199
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,324
There's not a day goes past
that I don't think of her.

200
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,411
I'll never forget our final moments.

201
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,874
Help me! My husband's trying to kill me!

202
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:58,963
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

203
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,549
– Do me a favour.
– What?

204
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,663
I want to feel like Melissa
is alive just one last time.

205
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,246
Here's a selection of her lingerie.

206
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:12,670
Mr Reynholm!

207
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:14,897
Please dress as my sexy dead wife!

208
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,765
This isn't working out.

209
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,496
I thought, given time,
you'd get past the sex thing,

210
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,379
but you obviously can't.

211
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,759
I'm going back to IT,
where my skills are appreciated.

212
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,587
I'm not interested in you
sexually and I never will be.

213
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:35,305
I didn't want it to come to this, Jen.

214
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:37,889
But would you like a cup of tea?

215
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,830
Very busy. Leave a message.

216
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,822
Before you do this, you're sure

217
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:58,298
you can hit it so that it won't
damage my teeth as it goes in?

218
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,691
It's a very simple chip shot.

219
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:11,206
You totalled that cup, dude!

220
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:14,708
OK, one more try.

221
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:18,943
– Jen would never let us do this!
– No, she'd be like, "This is dangerous,

222
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,780
"you can hit Moss in the face."

223
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,806
How many more things have
we got left on the list?

224
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,474
I think we've done nearly all of them.

225
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:34,968
Yeah. OK, we've had a little sleep,
we've walked around in our pants...

226
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,947
The only thing left to do
is a prank phone-call.

227
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:41,490
All right,
but let's concentrate on this first.

228
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,571
OK, do it again.

229
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,320
Two lovely cups of tea.

230
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,331
I'm like your P.A.,
'cause I made the tea!

231
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,305
Hang on...

232
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:14,241
We both take it the same way, Douglas.

233
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:21,846
– Aren't you gonna drink it?
– I will in a bit.

234
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,755
So, well done on passing the test, Jen.

235
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:26,537
– The test?
– Yes!

236
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,958
Those clumsy seduction.
Don't say you couldn't see through it.

237
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:34,167
They were a test to find out whether
you really wanted to work for me

238
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:37,637
or whether you just wanted
to come up here for my body.

239
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,367
No, no. Not at all.

240
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,676
– All right.
– No. Physically,

241
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:45,569
– you're not the sort of man I go for.
– Yeah, thanks.

242
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:49,574
I go for classically good-looking men.
Blond, broad, clean-shaven.

243
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,197
All right! Enough of the jibber jabber!

244
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:56,695
I want you to watch this DVD
presentation I've just made.

245
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:58,395
Any thoughts?

246
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,776
– I haven't seen it yet.
– Then see it now!

247
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,765
Hello, I'd like to order a pizza,
please.

248
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:18,058
Can I have it with extra grapes?

249
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,601
Grapes? What are you like?

250
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,975
Yes, a pizza with grapes, please.

251
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,178
What?

252
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,704
You have a pizza with grapes?

253
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:35,129
Do grapes even go with pizza?

254
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,839
Oh, I see. Oh, you got me!

255
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:44,495
Oh, very funny. Very mature.
You're only wasting your own time.

256
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,994
I wish I could've seen
the look on his face!

257
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,346
I can't believe we've done
the whole list.

258
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,304
We've really done all eight items?

259
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,142
You wanna play Guitar Hero?

260
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,489
– I hate those kinds of games.
– Right

261
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,450
– I've got one!
– What?

262
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,884
Why don't we ring them up again

263
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,417
and ask if they do a pizza
with pineapple on it?

264
00:18:38,973 --> 00:18:41,014
Maybe somebody's computer will break.

265
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:46,134
I think you'd enjoy this more
while drinking your tea.

266
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:52,279
Reynholm Industries. A big hard business
in a big, hard building.

267
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:56,687
Busting into the future
strongly, again and again.

268
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,626
Pounding the future.

269
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,861
Making the future beg for it.

270
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:02,570
The future wants it!

271
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:05,510
And Reynholm Industries wants
to give it to the future.

272
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,711
That's what it's all about.

273
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,219
We don't want to be like a dead fly,

274
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,933
regretting what we didn't do
in our short time on this earth.

275
00:19:14,164 --> 00:19:16,279
So maybe it's time to make a decision.

276
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,750
– What was that?

277
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,554
– What? What happened?
– Something flashed up there.

278
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,291
– Really? Are you sure?
– Let me rewind.

279
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:28,476
There it is again!

280
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,265
Something's wrong with your laptop.

281
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:32,871
I'll call the boys.

282
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,669
Roy, hello.
I didn't hear the phone ring.

283
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:41,602
– Oh, hey, Jen! Jen! Hello! It's Jen!
– Hello, Jen!

284
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:44,555
– Hi.
– How are you, Jen?

285
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,628
– Good. Listen, Douglas's computer...
– What's been happening?

286
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:50,959
– What?
– How's everything upstairs?

287
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,413
– Tell her I'm here!
– Moss is with me!

288
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:55,824
You know I spoke to you 4 hours ago?

289
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:59,936
– Hello, Jen!
– Jen, when are you coming back down?

290
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,953
– Let me speak!
– No! I'm talking to her!

291
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:07,359
I don't know. Listen, Douglas's
laptop is having some difficulties.

292
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:10,036
So, can you come up
and have a look?

293
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,872
Oh, no, not these idiots.

294
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:18,137
Mr Reynholm, the men
in the IT department are my friends.

295
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:20,167
They're not idiots.

296
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:29,134
– What the hell is this?
– Where the hell are your trousers?

297
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,407
I get it. When the cat's away. Yeah.

298
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:37,372
It's like all the fun I had
just after my wife died.

299
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:40,183
Listen, don't sit on anything. And...

300
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:44,547
Mr Reynholm's laptop is broken.
Something flashed up a second ago.

301
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,042
I'll help! No!

302
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,571
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

303
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:50,023
No, we haven't.

304
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,571
– Well, let's have a little look.
– I want a go!

305
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:55,102
– I want to do a job!
– You'll do the next one!

306
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,654
Don't touch that.

307
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,768
Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?

308
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:06,695
Flunitrazepam... Yep,
that's definitely Rohypnol.

309
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,276
Do you have with insomnia?

310
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,798
– That's nonsense.
– Drink it, then.

311
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:13,718
All right, I will.

312
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,135
There we go.
Perfectly normal cup of tea.

313
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:23,854
Now if you don't mind,
I have some filoffing to do.

314
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,082
– Filoffing?
– Yes,

315
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:30,385
I have some filoffels that need
pipping and I'm the mulder.

316
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,344
You did put something in that tea!

317
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:35,335
Damn that sorcerer!

318
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:38,428
20 gold pieces and I'm wankered
on Rohypnol!

319
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,778
Oh, God, Rohypnol!

320
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,151
And what's the matter with you?

321
00:21:44,451 --> 00:21:45,970
I just saw his film.

322
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,742
I didn't care for it.

323
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,662
I am very aroused.

324
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,402
I want to come back downstairs with you.

325
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,761
No, it's all right,
we've got a replacement.

326
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,275
– Shut up!
– All right, OK. Who's that?

327
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,550
– It's an answering machine.
– An answering machine?

328
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,067
It's called Jen 2.
It does everything you do

329
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,011
and it doesn't boss us about.
It is brilliant.

330
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,635
Shut up, for God's sake!

331
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,077
You replaced me
with an answering machine?

332
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,805
OK, I think we should
probably leave now.

333
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,565
I don't really like
the look in his eyes.

334
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,675
Yeah, let's go, let's go. Where's Jen?

335
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,928
Pucker up, boys. It's hammer time!

336
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:35,570
You lot deserve each other!

337
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:40,753
I think you've accidentally
locked the door there, Jen!
