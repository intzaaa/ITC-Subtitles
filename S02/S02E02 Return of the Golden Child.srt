1
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:37,284
Which means, which means...

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,768
a profit so far this year of...

3
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,933
1800 billion billions.
– Splendid!

4
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,179
This doesn't even include
the added revenue

5
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,979
arising for your take over of ITV!

6
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,988
ITV? I'd forgotten about ITV.
Brilliant!

7
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,503
Gentleman, when I first started
Reynholm Industries,

8
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,695
I had just two things
in my possession:

9
00:00:56,288 --> 00:00:58,477
a dream and 6 million pounds.

10
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:02,845
Today, I have a business empire,
the like of which...

11
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,294
the world has never seen
the like of which.

12
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,101
Hope it doesn't sound arrogant
when I say...

13
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:11,642
that I am the greatest man
in the world!

14
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:15,800
Gentleman, to the future.

15
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:19,571
Oh, you don't have any glasses.
Just pretend.

16
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,108
– To the future!
– To the future!

17
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:26,218
Sorry to interrupt
but there are some policemen here,

18
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,151
they say they need to speak to you

19
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,486
about irregularities
in the pension fund.

20
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,471
I see. Could you make me a cup of tea,
please, Stephanie?

21
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,217
Nice.

22
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:57,752
–Isn't she a beauty?
– It's certainly a phone.

23
00:01:58,726 --> 00:02:00,844
160 PPI screen.

24
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,577
Wi-Fi enables...
– Ask me what kind of phone I've got.

25
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:06,863
– What kind of phone have you got?
– It doesn't matter.

26
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,768
Voice recognition.
So let's say I wanted to call my mum,

27
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:12,947
I just have to say "mum",
and it calls her.

28
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,684
I don't need to do anything.
It's the dog's bollocks.

29
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,286
Mum, mum, no...

30
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,564
No, I'm sorry.
No, Moss said that.

31
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,406
Yeah, okay, I'll call you later, bye.

32
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,347
Only problem with it is that it's got
a very weedy vibrate setting.

33
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,760
I mean, watch this.

34
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:34,933
I mean, what is that?

35
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,826
– I'll sort it out.
– Oh, could you?

36
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,215
Just you know, welly up
the vibrator a bit.

37
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:41,856
Okay, all right.
Now, will you answer this question?

38
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:43,227
Are we still on this?

39
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,733
You keep interrupting!
We would've been done ages ago,

40
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,613
but you...
– All right, go on.

41
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:50,637
Question 39.
When was the last time you exercise?

42
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:55,508
The last time I exercised was never.

43
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:59,312
I'm still reeling
from your answer to question 12.

44
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,771
What was question 12?

45
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,221
You brush your teeth in the bath.

46
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,805
– So?
– That's where your balls are.

47
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,317
Okay, question 40.

48
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,095
Do you get your five fruit and veg?

49
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,917
I mean, I certainly try to...
I would say I probably do.

50
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:18,491
– A day.
– A what?

51
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:22,038
You're going to love this.

52
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:24,549
This website takes
all the information you gave me

53
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:25,889
and guess what it does?

54
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:28,470
It actually estimates
the date of your death!

55
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,551
– What?
– I know.

56
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:32,954
Unbelievable, isn't it?
– What? Wait a second.

57
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:35,868
I know about those!
Everyone knows about those!

58
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,164
All right, so you've already done it.
So, when's the big day?

59
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:40,215
No!

60
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,927
I haven't done it!
Why would I want to do it?

61
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,157
– I get March 2nd 2079.
– Oh, my God!

62
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:48,192
That's right, baby!
I've got 70 more years!

63
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,423
Okay, Moss, close that window!

64
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,249
– I do not wanna know!
– But I've written it all in now.

65
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:53,644
Moss!

66
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:55,695
I do not wanna know
the date of my death.

67
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,308
Close it.

68
00:03:58,564 --> 00:04:00,499
Hello, IT, have you tried
turning it off and...

69
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,299
You know, I'm sick of saying that.

70
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,857
What do you want?

71
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,832
Okay, yeah, someone
will be up in a minute.

72
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,446
Maybe.

73
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,805
You looked!

74
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:24,858
You know!

75
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,877
You know when I'm going to die!

76
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,034
I do, yes.

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,643
– I told you not to look!
– I made a mistake.

78
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,430
When is it?

79
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,576
– You don't wanna know.
– You can't say that to me now!

80
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,818
My advice, Roy,
is to forget all about this.

81
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:50,141
What, how long more
they've given me, 20 years?

82
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,692
It's less than twenty?

83
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,629
You see, I don't think
this is taking into account leap years.

84
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,851
So that could well be
something to hang on to.

85
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,963
What does it say, Moss?

86
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,804
Does it say I'm already dead?

87
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,059
– No, that would be terrible.
– Thank God.

88
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,020
– It's Thursday.
– What?

89
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,550
– It's Thursday.
– Thursday?

90
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,927
Again, remember, leap years.

91
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:18,635
It's Thursday!

92
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,753
Thursday the 3rd!

93
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:23,940
Although, not too late after noon,
so that gives you most of the day.

94
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,598
What? 3 p.m.!

95
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:29,123
– How could they be that specific?
– Yeah, it's silly.

96
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,538
Yeah.

97
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,097
These things are, at best,
79% accurate.

98
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,024
Oh, good.

99
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:39,077
I would take no further notice of it.

100
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,353
Yeah, you're right, it's silly.

101
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,651
I will take no further notice of it.

102
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:49,621
Apparently, there's something wrong with
all the computers on 7th. Who wants it?

103
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:50,617
Roy?

104
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,688
You look terrible. Are you ill?

105
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:57,462
I don't know.

106
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,782
These idiots disabled
the flipping firewall!

107
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,256
Yeah, hello, excuse me.

108
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:10,082
Thank you, some attention please.

109
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:12,111
I know you don't think it's "important"

110
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,945
or "cool" but there is
a ruddy good reason

111
00:06:15,085 --> 00:06:17,846
why we put up anti-virus software
and firewalls.

112
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,048
It's because there are
a lot of dangerous things out there.

113
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,428
Jesus!

114
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:24,752
You know, calm down.

115
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,467
Just don't disable the firewalls.

116
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,542
Okay, 73', that's good, that's good.

117
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,188
And mum,
what age did Uncle Tony die?

118
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,039
32?

119
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,264
It was a car accident?
Brilliant!

120
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,691
Okay, no, I completely forgot... Okay.

121
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,124
Mum, I have to go.

122
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,641
Unbelievable,
some brainiac disabled his firewall

123
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,206
which means that all the computers
on floor 7 are teeming with viruses.

124
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:54,358
Plus, I've just had to walk all the way
down the mother fudging stairs

125
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,928
because the lift is broken, again.

126
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,637
Oh, my God.

127
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,577
– What?
– Oh, my God.

128
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:01,814
What? What it is?

129
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,175
Denholm is dead.

130
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:05,980
Oh, yes, and Denholm is dead.

131
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:12,677
Okay, everyone ready?

132
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,261
You look great.
We should go to more funerals.

133
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,150
Yeah, except, is there any chance
I could...

134
00:07:20,436 --> 00:07:22,605
not go to this one?
– No, why?

135
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,490
It's just, you know, funerals.

136
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,488
So morbid.

137
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,121
Would you please forget
this website nonsense?

138
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,029
You are not going to die.

139
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,730
Come on, cheer up!
You're gonna ruin the funeral.

140
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,251
Yeah, you're right.
Pay no attention to me.

141
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,963
I'm being an idiot.

142
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,574
Dead man walking!

143
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,609
Very funny.

144
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,965
You crazy little bastard!

145
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:52,237
When did you last exercise, Jen?

146
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:54,461
No, you are not going to do it to me.

147
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,231
– Scared?
– No.

148
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,595
I happen to think
I have a good few years left.

149
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:01,542
I take plenty of exercise
and I haven't smoked for 3 years.

150
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,379
I didn't know you smoked.

151
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:05,200
I was on 40 a day by the end.

152
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:08,276
40 a day, that's 146 002 a decade.

153
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,229
Presuming at least two leap years.
How the flip do you give up?

154
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:14,066
Basically, pure self-control, Moss.

155
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,149
No, I'd never smoke again.

156
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,263
I'd rather lick a tramp.
Derek, hello.

157
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,492
Hello, Jen.

158
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,057
Thanks for printing out
those funeral announcements.

159
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,138
Oh, no, I enjoyed doing it.

160
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,372
You know, in a sad way.

161
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:35,710
– Can I have a word, please?
– Sure.

162
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,985
Hey, oh, my phone.

163
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,926
Oh cool, have you souped up?

164
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:46,578
Yeah, I totally pimped your phone,
girlfriend.

165
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,300
What set are you setting?

166
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,498
That is the lowest setting.

167
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,494
It shall come as no surprise to you
that I don't like this department.

168
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,052
Never have, never will.

169
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:08,165
I see no need for an IT department,

170
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:11,165
I would much rather use this basement
for something important.

171
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,078
Like a big toilet!

172
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:17,542
I have to say that actually,
it's a bit of a surprise.

173
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,665
– Really? I did send out a memo.
– I didn't get it.

174
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,375
– I had no idea you felt like this.
– Well, I do.

175
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:26,914
However, I am prepared to give you
another chance.

176
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:29,804
Another chance? But I didn't know
we'd already had a chance.

177
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,887
This should be the first chance.
You should give us this chance.

178
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,531
And then, another chance.

179
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,902
OK, I'll get it! Give me a call!

180
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,863
I got to put it up to 5.

181
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,402
I'm gonna put it in my pocket!

182
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:00,128
Put it up to 8!
Put it up to 8!

183
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:03,175
I'm not gonna put it up to 8, Moss!
It'll blow my cock off.

184
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,157
– Come on, come on. Put it up!
– Okay, I'll put it up.

185
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:13,653
You do know
we are burying a great man today!

186
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,161
Did someone else die?

187
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,797
I mean, Mr. Reynholm!

188
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:21,797
Yeah.

189
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:25,555
"Did someone else die?"

190
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:26,872
Oh, I didn't know.

191
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,517
You have to be careful,
he's our new boss.

192
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:32,020
He hates us, he keeps saying
that there's no need

193
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,983
for an IT department.
– Why didn't anyone tell me this?

194
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:36,885
There was a memo.
It just said:

195
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,735
"I hate the IT Department."

196
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,527
Oh no, no, no!

197
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,889
You are not coming to the funeral,
Richmond!

198
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:47,595
What funeral?

199
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:11,413
– Has anyone got the right time?
– It's twenty to three.

200
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:13,149
I'll make it a quarter, too.

201
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:17,300
Why? Yes! Because that website said
you were going to die at 3pm, didn't it?

202
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,626
– Did it? I can't remember.
– How could you forget?

203
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:23,316
It clearly stated that
you were going to die, today.

204
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:26,184
At precisely 3:00.
Unless, it was tomorrow.

205
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:29,113
But no, it's today, at 3:00.

206
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,239
Well, would you put it
out of your mind?

207
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,286
Right, you're right, out of my mind.

208
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:53,308
Okay, there's Denholm's wife.

209
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,352
I never know what to say
to people at funeral.

210
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,016
Neither do I. I'm terrible.

211
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,918
Oh, just say "I'm sorry for your lost",
then move on.

212
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:06,282
– He'll be in our prayers.
– Thank you.

213
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,217
– Sorry for your loss.
– Thank you.

214
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,391
Move on.

215
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,350
– Sorry for your loss.
– Thank you.

216
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,514
It's not like you've lost a pen, is it?

217
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,919
It's so much worse.

218
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,419
Would you like a pen?

219
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,650
–I have this spare one.
– Oh, no, thank you.

220
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:32,138
– Please, take it.
– Why are you giving it to me?

221
00:12:32,965 --> 00:12:34,063
I don't know.

222
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,482
It swings an under balance.

223
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,947
Death!

224
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,128
Death is coming!

225
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,353
Death is here...

226
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:57,602
Death is outside...

227
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,589
There's no escape.

228
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:02,510
I don't like the way
Derek's looking at us.

229
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,748
Who's that knocking at the door?

230
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:10,865
Yes...

231
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,127
It's death! Yet it'd be.

232
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:14,798
Is this normal?

233
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,069
Death came for Denholm
just as it will come for you.

234
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,831
Who will be next?

235
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:22,939
You?

236
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:24,877
Maybe you...

237
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:30,330
– We are gathered here to...
– What's wrong with you?

238
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,923
– ...past of a great man.
– Nothing.

239
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:35,462
A man...

240
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:37,295
...like us.

241
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:43,225
I've never seen a grand-father clock
in a church before.

242
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:45,140
Yet, the one was a second hand.

243
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,082
Yes, he had more money than...

244
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:51,134
most of us here today.
But did that make him a better man?

245
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,826
We know Denholm was a man of money.

246
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,419
Yes, he had more money...

247
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,530
than any of us here.

248
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,124
Oh, no! Jesus!

249
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,756
Jesus Christ!

250
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:21,508
Holy...!
Call me an ambulance!

251
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,985
I'm not f****** joking!

252
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:25,526
And get an ambulance!

253
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,859
I'm not f****** joking!

254
00:14:28,071 --> 00:14:30,012
Call me a f****** ambulance!

255
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:34,899
Oh, no, wait...

256
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:37,658
That's my phone!

257
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,602
I think that... It's...

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,311
Let's see if... I can't leave it.

259
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:49,906
I can't leave it. I'll turn it off.
I've just been set up.

260
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:52,415
Oh, God f***!

261
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,406
Go on!

262
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:00,741
Oh, it's gone to message.

263
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,940
Hey, Roy, nothing important!
Just wondering how the funeral went.

264
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,281
Call me back.

265
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,913
If we are all quite ready,

266
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,974
Denholm instructed that this short film
be played before the service.

267
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,024
You're all out of there!
You are out of there!

268
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,566
You're history!

269
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:27,507
Hello!

270
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,346
If you're watching this,
it means I'm dead, now.

271
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,846
And it's all thanks
to these little things.

272
00:15:33,655 --> 00:15:35,148
– Wrong!
– Shut up!

273
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:40,082
Cigarettes have finally killed me.

274
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,819
Like they killed my father,
my father's father,

275
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:46,207
my mother's father, my mother,
and her father.

276
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:50,582
I just can't seem to give
the damn things up. I love them!

277
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,823
Sweet smoky cigarettes.

278
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,898
You delicious bastards!

279
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,754
Final clause, Stephanie,

280
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,218
could you categorise the personel files
alphabetically from now on?

281
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:25,440
That rhyming thing, this isn't working.

282
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,144
Also call Who's Who
and get them to update my entry.

283
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,927
Well, thanks everyone for coming!
Enjoy the rest of the funeral.

284
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:41,884
Well said, sir!

285
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:45,145
I will now ask Mr. Pippin
to read the eulogy.

286
00:16:51,882 --> 00:16:53,800
I see a lot of faces out there.

287
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,605
Some of you I know, some of you
I hope to get to know better

288
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,437
over the coming months.

289
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:02,990
Some of you I probably won't be
seeing very much off, after today!

290
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,035
The reading of the eulogy

291
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:09,207
is a duty normally left
to the eldest child.

292
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,485
But, as you all know,
Denholm's son Douglas

293
00:17:12,682 --> 00:17:16,515
mysteriously disappeared
after a lengthy court case, 7 years ago.

294
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:21,562
Let me start by reading this poem
that I saw

295
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,333
in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral.

296
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,474
"Stop... all the clocks."

297
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,440
Father!

298
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,618
– Tits!
– We're just a small church.

299
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,027
Unhappy priest!

300
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,927
Where is your God?

301
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,021
Where is your God now!

302
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,870
Here lies a great man!

303
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:13,738
A great man!

304
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:16,029
Father!

305
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:24,068
– Did I miss anything?
– They just started Denholm's eulogy.

306
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:27,746
You stink!

307
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,394
I just smoked a cigarette from a drain.

308
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,484
Well, who's this?

309
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:36,790
– Hi, I'm Douglas.
– Jen Barber.

310
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,890
Beautiful second name!
What're you doing after the funeral?

311
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,519
– Douglas!
– Speak, priest!

312
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,618
No, I'm a vic...
Your father prepared a second tape

313
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:49,405
in the event of your sudden arrival.
– A second tape?

314
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:50,854
I see...

315
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:54,615
Actually, I don't follow.
– I'll just put in on.

316
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,637
Hello again. If you're watching this,

317
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,595
it's because my son from my 1st marriage
has arrived,

318
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,420
caused a scene, and is currently
chatting up some nearby trouble.

319
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,890
Quiet, woman!

320
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,167
I have something important
to tell you.

321
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:15,782
I'm here, papa!

322
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,502
Reynholm Industries is now yours.

323
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,406
– My Lord, thank you father.
– But it's yours at a price.

324
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,382
I want you to promise me now,
in front of all your new employees,

325
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:28,256
that you will never again

326
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,932
become embroiled
in a sexual harassment case

327
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,443
that dangers the company.
– I promise, father.

328
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,996
There's one more thing,
but it's for your ears only.

329
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,597
So, I want you to stop the tape,
take it home,

330
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:45,076
and watch it again later in private.
– But these are my new family, father.

331
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,639
I have no secrets from them!

332
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,063
OK, Douglas. Now we're alone,
I can speak frankly.

333
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:52,793
You may receive a visit
from the police at some point

334
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:55,050
concerning irregularities
in the pension fund.

335
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,238
Turn that off.

336
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:59,824
I've been using a very creative
accountant recently released from jail

337
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:04,100
to manage what I call the suck fund!
– Where is the remote?

338
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:07,019
– Now, the suck fund...
– I'll do it myself!

339
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,506
Good bye, father!

340
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:15,970
Right, I'm off.
I'll see you all on Monday.

341
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:17,919
Douglas! Sorry,

342
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,091
I didn't mean to. Derek Pippin!

343
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,275
I worked very closely with your father.

344
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,146
Derek, good to meet you.

345
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm afraid I'll be bringing in my own
people, so you're immediately fired.

346
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,916
Okay, good luck everyone, and...

347
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:32,621
I'll see you later.

348
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:40,191
– ...and you are ready to go!
– Brilliant!

349
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:42,382
Thank you, computer man!

350
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:47,540
I'm told my father was particularly
proud of the IT department.

351
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:49,754
Run by a dynamic go-getter,

352
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,910
a genius, and a man from Ireland!

353
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,409
One last thing.

354
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,933
How do I erase files like this one here,
marked pensions?

355
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,321
– Just like this.
– All gone!

356
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,505
Wonderful. Thanks, guys.

357
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,282
I'll be working very closely
with your department.

358
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:08,969
And I have a feeling I'll be needing you

359
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,443
for a lot more than
just deleting incriminating files.

360
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,565
I just mean files.

361
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,715
– OK, we'd better be off.
– By the way...

362
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:25,441
Where's that ootsie-tootsie
humdinging-coochie mama-boss of yours?

363
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,259
She went home early.
She said she had some catching up to do.

364
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,630
One last thing.

365
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,815
I sorted out this for you.

366
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:44,562
Now, I'm afraid the vibrate setting
is still a little weedy.

367
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:47,069
So, you may wanna
put it all the way up to ten.

368
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,498
Ten!

369
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:51,382
Shall I do...

370
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:53,388
...done...

371
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:54,982
...and done!

372
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:56,977
Okay, bye-bye...

373
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,384
Sorry about this, old man!

374
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:13,377
Oh, yes.

375
00:22:23,178 --> 00:22:24,499
Now, I like that!

376
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:42,758
Nearly at the station!
