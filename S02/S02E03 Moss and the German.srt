1
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,087
You wouldn't steal a handbag.

2
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,717
You wouldn't steal a car.

3
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,807
You wouldn't steal a baby.

4
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,897
You wouldn't shoot a policeman

5
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,687
and then steal his helmet.

6
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:53,597
You wouldn't go to the toilet in his helmet

7
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:58,557
and then send it
to the policeman's grieving widow,

8
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,217
and then steal it again.

9
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:07,107
Downloading films is stealing.

10
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:12,007
If you do it,
you will face the consequences.

11
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,747
Man, these anti-piracy ads
are getting really mean.

12
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,007
I think we're sitting too close to the screen.

13
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:25,007
– And the floor's all sticky over here.
– All right. OK, let's move back, then.

14
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:37,007
– I still think we're too close.
– Well, then, sit in the sink.

15
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:39,157
I'm not sitting in the sink again.

16
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,777
OK, princess.

17
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:44,007
Your flat is way too small for this telly.

18
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,627
That's nonsense.

19
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:51,197
– What's wrong with you now?
– I need to go to the toilet.

20
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:52,707
Well, then, go.

21
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,017
I'll hold it in.

22
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:04,897
– Hello?
– Hello, Roy.

23
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:06,807
Hello, Jeff.

24
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,997
Now, Roy, you know
I changed my name by deed poll.

25
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:12,407
– I'm not calling you Dominator, Jeff.
– But I am Dominator!

26
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,827
– Yeah, whatever. I'm not calling you it.
– Forget it.

27
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,577
Um... Now, listen, I was just wondering,
have you seen the new Tarantino film?

28
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:22,107
– Yeah, actually I'm just about to watch it.
– I have already seen it.

29
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:26,667
Anyway, right, at the end,
there's a very unusual twist.

30
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,667
Oh!

31
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:30,387
Oh, no!

32
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:34,067
Oh, now I know there's a twist! I'm gonna
spend the whole film guessing what it is.

33
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,287
Damn you, Dominator.

34
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,877
– Just try and forget that there's a twist.
– Oh, how can you forget there's a twist?

35
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:43,897
Oh, what's wrong with it now? Oh, come on!

36
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:45,817
If I don't see this film today

37
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:46,877
then Jeff'll find out some way

38
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:48,677
of telling me what the twist is.

39
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,377
I know he will. Come on! Work!

40
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,107
Oh, look, I have to go.

41
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:57,927
Moss.

42
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,407
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

43
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:02,867
– What's up with you?
– I can't do this any more.

44
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:04,547
Do what? Moss, what are you talking about?

45
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,547
Here, let me help...

46
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:08,677
- Back off.
- We're just watching a film, Moss.

47
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:10,377
Come on, Roy. Can't you see it?

48
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:11,877
See what, Moss?

49
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,757
We go to a film, sometimes the pub,
maybe get some dinner,

50
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,777
but it just goes on and on, year in, year out.
We're stagnating.

51
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,227
You're making it sound
like we're some sort of old married couple.

52
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,977
But we are. Can't you see? You're my wife,
Roy, you're my wife.

53
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,807
You're my wife.

54
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:27,577
We should be married to ladies,
but we're married to each other.

55
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:29,787
– You're my wife.
– Could you stop calling me your wife?

56
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,527
You're my wife, Roy,
and I can't take it any more!

57
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:39,997
If anything, I'm the husband.

58
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:32,937
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's this? What's this?

59
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,227
Oh, come on.

60
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,007
We don't even have ventilation down here.

61
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:36,907
I'll stand over here.

62
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,437
I don't care. No.

63
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:41,737
I don't wanna go out on the street.
It's too...

64
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:43,737
Soviet out there.

65
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:45,417
«Soviet»?

66
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,237
Yes. It's cold, everyone looks oppressed.

67
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:50,837
You know, I remember when smoking was fun.

68
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:52,617
All the cool kids were doing it.

69
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,757
Every time I want a cigarette now

70
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:56,247
I have to go to Gorky Park.

71
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,167
Oh, don't answer that.

72
00:04:58,267 --> 00:04:58,697
Why not?

73
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:01,247
I know who that is.
That's a man called Dominator,

74
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,747
who wants to tell me the twist in a film

75
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,447
that I've been waiting to see for ages.
Don't answer it.

76
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:07,157
– "Dominator"?
– His real name is Jeff Hawthorne.

77
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,727
– We have to answer the phone.
– No, no, we don't.

78
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,427
No, look... he'll give up in a second.
I know Jeff.

79
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,627
He'll need to go to the toilet
in about another two rings.

80
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:25,117
– We're answering the phone.
– We are not answering the phones.

81
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,467
– You all right, Moss?
– I've got the blues, Jen.

82
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:37,627
Why?

83
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,777
Well, Roy and I are becoming
like an old married couple.

84
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,987
Will you please stop saying that?

85
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:44,507
And I'm the husband!

86
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,657
We just seem to do the same thing
day in, day out.

87
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:50,877
I'm stagnating, Jen,
like a packet of crisps on the roof.

88
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,547
It seems to me the problem is
that you two spend too much time together.

89
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,707
You should get out there
and meet other people.

90
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,677
Other people?

91
00:05:59,507 --> 00:06:00,607
Yes.

92
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:06,557
– You mean people other than Roy?
– Well, yes.

93
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,067
And these "other people",
where do they congregate?

94
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:12,787
I don't know, you could try
and do an evening class.

95
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:15,367
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second now.
And what exactly am I supposed to do

96
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:18,197
while she's out gallivanting
at her night classes and whatnot?

97
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,177
Well, you could meet other people as well.

98
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,767
Yeah... I don't like people.

99
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:26,337
Oh, well, now, that's not fair, Roy.
Have you met all of them?

100
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:27,857
I've met enough of them.

101
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:32,377
People! What a bunch of bastards.

102
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,417
Stephanie. Yes, hello.

103
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,077
Oh, of course. OK. Bye.

104
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:44,037
Ooh. I'm off. Douglas is coming down.

105
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,897
Douglas? Why?

106
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,197
Well, to be honest with you,
he's been making advances.

107
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,357
You know, little things like asking me

108
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,567
if I wanna go for a ride in his helicopter.

109
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,237
Oh, I'd like to go for a ride in a helicopter.

110
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:55,677
Well, grow a pair of tits.

111
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,307
Tell you what, if I did have tits

112
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:01,407
I wouldn't mind letting someone have a go on them

113
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,907
for a ride in a helicopter.

114
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:07,787
Look who it is, everyone. It's only me.

115
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,417
Jen, do you have a moment?

116
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:13,417
No, I don't, I'm very busy.
I don't wanna go for a ride in the helicopter.

117
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:16,027
That wasn't what I was gonna ask, actually.

118
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,387
What do you want, then?

119
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:21,237
Something, uh, work-related.

120
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:25,067
– What department is this?
– Sorry?

121
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:28,717
Well, if it's work-related then obviously
you'll know what department this is.

122
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,417
What department is this?

123
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,867
Some sort of, uh... homosexual department?

124
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,017
– IT! It's IT!
– IT!

125
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:40,627
I knew that, yes.
That's what I wanted, actually.

126
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:45,047
You see, my computer's broken
and I need someone to fix it.

127
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,047
Roy's your man.

128
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:54,747
How you fellas get any work done with
a hot piece of finger-licking chicken like that.

129
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:59,017
Me, I'd be a 24-hour tripod.

130
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,877
What's this? It looks good.

131
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,897
Um... yeah. I've actually been
really looking forward to seeing this.

132
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:08,597
Yeah? You wanna come round to mine?
We can watch it there.

133
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,887
I've got a pretty nifty home cinema system.

134
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,987
Um... well, mine is broken,
but I think that maybe I'll just watch it...

135
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,637
Well, excellent. That's settled then.
Seven o'clock tonight.

136
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:19,897
I'll get my PA to phone you
with my name and address.

137
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,027
Ciao.

138
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:26,857
Whoa, there. That's not my office.
Ciao.

139
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,777
Well, what's good for the goose
is good for the gander.

140
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,497
And I'm the gander!

141
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,147
I hear the ballet
in Prague is excellent this season.

142
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:48,107
– Hello, Jorg.
– Hello, Jen.

143
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,127
Terrible, isn't it?
Every year it gets worse.

144
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,417
First they take away our smoking room,

145
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,587
then they push us outside.

146
00:08:56,727 --> 00:09:00,067
I wonder when they will decide
just to get it over with and kill us.

147
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,967
Oh, Jorg, such a pessimist.

148
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,797
– Has he gone?
– Has who gone?

149
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,837
- Bruce Wayne.
- Oh, he's long gone.

150
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:13,117
Although Roy's got a man date with him.

151
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:17,847
It is not a man date.
I am not a man-woman.

152
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,157
We are not married.
I am not your wife!

153
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:22,967
You'd willingly spend time with Douglas?

154
00:09:23,107 --> 00:09:25,107
I really have to see this film soon.

155
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:32,297
Oh, by the way, I took your advice
about those evening classes.

156
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:35,327
– I'm going to learn how to cook.
– Oh, I'm so pleased, Moss.

157
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,617
And I have to say, women do love a cook.

158
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:39,437
Well, answered an ad online.

159
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:43,007
This time next month, when you want
German cuisine, I'm your man.

160
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,767
– German cuisine?
– Is German cuisine not good?

161
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:49,537
No. Sounds fine.

162
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:53,977
There's nothing more romantic than
a glass of wine and some Schweinefleisch.

163
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:59,367
Good, because usually when I try
something new it ends up a disaster.

164
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,977
I got a reply
to my advertisement.

165
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:05,857
Maurice Moss.

166
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:09,407
Mm. He sounds delicious!

167
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,487
Ah! Guten Abend!
I mean, hello.

168
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:48,127
- Hello. I'm Moss.
- Yes, yes, yes. I'm Johann. Come in, come in.

169
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:50,157
Oh. Nice TV.

170
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,127
Good distance from the sofa.

171
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,347
Um... Would you...
would you like a drink?

172
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,087
Oh, yes. White Russian, please.

173
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:00,827
– I don't know that. How do you make that?
– I don't know.

174
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:07,427
– Well, we might as well get to it.
– Really? Gosh. So eager, so brave.

175
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:10,967
Well, you know, once I've made up my mind
to do something, that's it.

176
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:14,377
– Oh, that's very admirable.
– So, really, just do whatever you want with me.

177
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,137
I'm ready for anything.

178
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,396
Well, right. Ah, well... I suppose...

179
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,197
– Take your clothes off and we'll get started.
– Right.

180
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,407
– So, how long does this course last?
– Uh, sorry?

181
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,227
– How long does this course last?
– Course? What course?

182
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:33,837
– Hang on. Take my clothes off?
– Yes.

183
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:37,997
– Sorry. I'm confused.
– Well, so am I.

184
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:42,667
_ What did you think this was?
– Well... I was going to eat you.

185
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:50,767
I may have misheard you there.

186
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,177
– Did you just say that you were going to eat me?
– Yes.

187
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,687
– Right, you did say that.
– Yes.

188
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:58,007
– Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.
– No, no, no, this is the cookery.

189
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:03,167
– Look, I've got your advert here.
– Yes.

190
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,167
– I printed it out.
– Yes.

191
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:10,387
– «I want to cook with you.»
– Ah, no, no. My English is not so good. Um...

192
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:11,687
Oh, right!

193
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:16,377
You want to cook with me,
using me, you mean.

194
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,907
– Ah, yes! Yes! You see?
– Yes, yes.

195
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:22,627
I see where the confusion was.
I thought this was a cookery course.

196
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:24,957
No, no.

197
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:28,547
But you were looking for someone
who would agree to let you kill and eat them.

198
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:29,797
Ja. Ja.

199
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,887
– You see?
– That is funny.

200
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:32,957
Ja.

201
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,857
So... you're not interested?

202
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,757
Oh, no, thanks very much.
It's not for me.

203
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:48,207
How disappointing.

204
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,677
I'm sorry, Johann.
This must be such a letdown.

205
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:58,187
Ohh! I had my tonsils out last month.
I could've kept them.

206
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,497
I feel like such a turnip.

207
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:07,707
– Do you want to watch a film?
– OK.

208
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,877
– I have Ocean's Eleven.
– Original or remake?

209
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:16,487
Well, yeah, you could come over here.
We could put on some music,

210
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,357
I could give you a back rub, see what happens.

211
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:23,307
Oh, no, wait, I've got this guy coming over
to watch a DVD.

212
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,097
Another time, maybe. OK.

213
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,507
Oh, and some chicken wings, please.
Thank you.

214
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,757
There's somebody at the door.
There's somebody at the door.

215
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:37,017
There's somebody at the door.

216
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:41,997
Hey, it's my G.

217
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:46,319
Um... I'm really sorry I was late.
It was...

218
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:51,527
It's cool, dude. Hey, you know,
we should do this sort of thing more often.

219
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:54,617
I hate the whole boss/employee thing,
don't you?

220
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:55,907
Yeah.

221
00:13:55,907 --> 00:13:57,467
You wanna seal the deal with a high-five?

222
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,187
Yes.

223
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:07,077
So, what are we watching?

224
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:10,567
It's a Tarantino-produced
South Korean zombie movie.

225
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:14,427
Wow, I didn't know there was a South Korea.
OK, put it on.

226
00:14:16,007 --> 00:14:17,307
I've ordered pizza and chicken wings,

227
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:20,137
and there's a cooler beside you,
so help yourself to beer.

228
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,587
Don't mind if I do.

229
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:37,287
Oh, I've heard of this flick.
There's a twist in it, isn't there?

230
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,597
Yeah. Just... just try and forget that

231
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,807
and hopefully we'll still be able to enjoy it.

232
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,937
I bet he's a woman, that bloke.

233
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:50,617
No, you think it's the future
but it's actually set in the past.

234
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:52,897
It's not Earth. It's all a dream.

235
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:59,007
Oh, could you not... could you...
Could you not try and guess what the twist is?

236
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,966
It's just that might get a little annoying.

237
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,601
But isn't that half the fun,
trying to guess the twist?

238
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:11,121
Uh... Personally, I think it...
it kind of... it ruins the fun.

239
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:15,035
– Well, I think it makes it more fun.
– It's just I don't.

240
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,417
Well, I do.

241
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:19,966
And I'm the boss.

242
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,521
I'm your boss.

243
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:33,003
They're all clones.
He's his own brother.

244
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,163
Everyone's a ghost.

245
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,957
– Have you still not seen the film yet?
– No!

246
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:43,397
– What's that?
– What?

247
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,277
It's cold, and I'm going out for a cigarette.

248
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:50,797
Morning.
Oh, you must be Jen's mother.

249
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:54,467
– What a night I had last night.
– Oh, yes, the cookery. How was it?

250
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:59,237
I am so embarrassed, I cannot tell you.

251
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,067
– What happened?
– It wasn't a cookery class at all.

252
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,637
What was it?

253
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:07,277
He wrote it down wrong
cos his English isn't very good.

254
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,517
Always the way.

255
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:13,157
And it turns out he didn't want
to teach me how to cook,

256
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,517
he wanted to cook me.

257
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:22,467
What?

258
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:25,817
He wanted to eat me.

259
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:30,297
I know - egg and my face were in alignment.

260
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,017
– He wanted to eat you?
– Yes.

261
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,857
He's one of those German cannibals.

262
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:43,297
– He is, and he was such a nice man.
– Oh, was he?

263
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:46,377
Yeah. He was a fine young cannibal.

264
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:52,697
– Hang on, hang on, he wanted to eat you?
– Yeah, keep up, Jen.

265
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:57,817
So we had a laugh about it, and in the end,
I didn't really feel like being eaten

266
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,057
so we just watched Ocean's Eleven.

267
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,997
- Ah. Original or remake?
- Is that really the most important question?

268
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,877
I... Hang on. You watched a...
you watched a film with him?

269
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:08,957
– Yes.
– With the man that wanted to eat you?

270
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,917
– Who else are we talking about?
– Why didn't you call the police?

271
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:15,197
– The police? Why would I call the police?
– He wanted to eat you!

272
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,917
Only with my consent and, believe me,
my consent was not forthcoming.

273
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,637
– Good for you, Moss.
– But...

274
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:25,357
– Eating people is illegal.
– Only without their consent.

275
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:28,357
– No, Moss. No, no, no.
– It's a grey area, give me that.

276
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:32,517
I knew something was askew.
Whoever heard of German food?

277
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,757
But you should see his place, it's incredible.
He's got a great system, 50-inch TV.

278
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,997
Really?

279
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,357
Maybe we could watch the film at his place.

280
00:17:44,487 --> 00:17:48,477
Oh, I don't know, Roy. He's only really
interested in people he can eventually eat.

281
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:50,797
Oh.
Tell him he can eat me.

282
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:53,957
Are... are you insane?
You've got to call the police.

283
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:59,637
Oh, Jen, don't be such an old fuddy-duddy.
The world has changed.

284
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:03,797
If two grown men can't make a pervert happy
for a few minutes

285
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:06,637
in order to watch a film about zombies,

286
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:10,597
then maybe we should all just move to Iran.

287
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:14,237
I don't know, Roy. It does seem
a little immoral to mislead him.

288
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:20,197
But, then, as Jen pointed out earlier,
being a cannibal's a little immoral too.

289
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:23,317
I'm in an ethical pickle.

290
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:28,677
Turns out meeting new people is a lot more
complicated than I'd originally thought.

291
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,777
– Jen.
– Jorg.

292
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,317
What are you doing?
You cannot smoke here.

293
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:42,717
– They are moving us to a new smoking area.
– Oh, so the rumours were true.

294
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:45,677
Come quick, before they see you.

295
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,407
– Jen, what are you doing?
– It's over, Jorg.

296
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:45,077
We must fight them, Jen.
We must all fight them.

297
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:47,557
We must keep smoking until the bitter end.

298
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,357
Jorg.

299
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:52,797
Jorg, such fire.

300
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:56,517
I am too tired for revolution.

301
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:59,477
And we've walked... miles.

302
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,357
Goodbye, Jorg.

303
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:09,267
Taxi!

304
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,437
– Let's not fight again.
– No.

305
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:17,257
– And, look, we're out, we're meeting people.
– Yes.

306
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,277
– You were a bit wonky.
– Thanks, dear.

307
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:28,677
Hello!

308
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,637
– Hello! How wonderful!
– Johann, this is Roy. Roy, this is Johann.

309
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,227
Hello, Johann. I brought dessert.

310
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,077
Ah! Come in, come in.

311
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:39,597
Ja.

312
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:43,957
– Oh, this is lovely.
– Yes. Yes. Lovely.

313
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,517
– Oh, isn't this nice?
– Yeah.

314
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,677
OK, so we'll watch the film and then
I'll just tell him I changed my mind.

315
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:53,517
Lovely, isn't it?

316
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:57,557
Oh, wow. Now that's a guitar.

317
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:04,277
So, Roy, has Moss explained to you
my, um... desires?

318
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,997
– He has indeed.
– And are you interested?

319
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:10,327
– I'm very interested.
– Ah, splendid!

320
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,487
Moss, if you will excuse us.

321
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:17,277
– Do you eat in here?
– Yes, this way, please.

322
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,497
But, Roy, didn't you want to watch this film
that I have here?

323
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:24,157
Oh, I'd completely forgotten.

324
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,357
There was that film
that I wanted to watch before Johann ate me.

325
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,637
– That's right.
– There it is there now.

326
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,067
– Yes.
– So, you... so, you want to watch a film?

327
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,877
– Yes, thanks.
– Is that OK?

328
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:39,007
– Uh... Yes, yes, of course.
– I'll put it on.

329
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,317
Is it very long?

330
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:48,637
Two hours 20.

331
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,037
Hm... No, I'll wait.

332
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,917
– You wouldn't steal a handbag...
– These piracy warnings!

333
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:01,547
I know! Very bad.

334
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:05,877
Oh, what now?

335
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:11,517
You wouldn't shoot a policeman
and then steal his helmet...

336
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,647
– Hello, there.
– Yes? Can I help you?

337
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,897
– Police! Don't move!
– Don't move!

338
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,887
If my mother thinks I'm a cannibal,
I'll be for the high jump.

339
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:26,587
Oh, for once can we please
not bring your mother into it?

340
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,697
Oh, here we go again.

341
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:37,007
Well, boys...

342
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,497
we're in a bit of a sticky situation, aren't we?

343
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:48,457
Where did you get this film?

344
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:52,297
This is an illegal copy of a film.

345
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,327
Are you not worried
that we might be cannibals?

346
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,057
Cannibals?

347
00:23:01,187 --> 00:23:07,217
The man who was with us is a cannibal.
He was going to eat me.

348
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:11,417
Well, it's not really my area.
I do copyright violation, that sort of thing.

349
00:23:11,547 --> 00:23:14,617
But I'll let someone know, thanks.
Anyway...

350
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,017
Where did you get this?

351
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,257
Interesting film.

352
00:23:23,387 --> 00:23:26,377
Who'd have thought at the end
that bloke turned out to be the...
