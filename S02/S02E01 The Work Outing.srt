1
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,405
I've just won four hundred
and fifty grand playing poker!

2
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:41,025
Well done!

3
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:43,687
I saw that one coming, Mickey73!

4
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:47,021
That's my rent sorted this month!
And I can buy that new...

5
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,011
Oh, no, I've lost it all again...

6
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:52,717
Jen?

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,014
Philip! Hello, hi.

8
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,313
This is Philip, from sixth.

9
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,157
This is Moss, this is... Roy.

10
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,027
– Hi.
– Hiya.

11
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:05,521
So, what brings you to my lair?

12
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:08,609
Not that I'm some sort of animal!

13
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:11,652
Or... maybe I am...

14
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:14,577
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

15
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,650
I was just...

16
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,913
wondering if you had...

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,215
the latest Heat?

18
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,662
Yes, yes. There it is.

19
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:26,195
Thanks.

20
00:01:27,143 --> 00:01:29,644
Sorry about this.
I don't suppose, maybe...

21
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,438
you'd like to come to theatre
tomorrow night, maybe, or...

22
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,251
I'd be delighted!

23
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:40,989
– He means me, Moss.
– He was looking at me.

24
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:44,286
No, he wasn't.

25
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:45,583
I think he was!

26
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:47,562
You're not even in his eye line!

27
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,055
Philip, who were you talking to?
Me or Jen?

28
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:53,647
– Do you like the theatre?
– Never been!

29
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:56,841
But I've always liked the idea
of the theatre.

30
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:58,496
The smell of the grease,

31
00:01:58,638 --> 00:01:59,898
the roar of the paint!

32
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,502
I've often thought
if I hadn't ended up in computers,

33
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:05,126
I would've gone into the theatre.

34
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:07,164
But you've never been to see a play?

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,656
– No.
– Why not?

36
00:02:09,387 --> 00:02:10,597
Never had the interest.

37
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,809
Are there any famous people in it?

38
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,174
– No.
– It's a pass for me then, thank you.

39
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:19,932
You haven't been invited anyways.
- Wait...

40
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:21,309
Laura Nightly's in it.

41
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:23,727
Laura Nightly from The Bill?

42
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,842
She's gorgeous!

43
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,436
You know what?
I will come, Philip. Thank you!

44
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,577
There's no invitation!
Show me the invitation...

45
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:33,860
I guess you guys could come too
if you wanted.

46
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,191
I know people in the show,
tickets won't be a problem.

47
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,612
Great! That's settled then.

48
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,791
Great! I will give you a call

49
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,746
and then give you the details.
How's that?

50
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:43,582
That is perfect in itself, Philip!

51
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,346
Thanks for coming down, man!

52
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:46,779
Catch you later!

53
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,411
That could have been a date, there...

54
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,467
Now, it's...

55
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,541
a work outing!

56
00:02:56,014 --> 00:02:57,743
Sorry! I forgot the Heat!

57
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:00,655
It's... it's...

58
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,729
What?

59
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:13,276
He actually did want
to borrow the copy of Heat.

60
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:20,087
– So?
– Well, it's just... you know...

61
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:23,531
– No, I don't. What?
– I'm just surprised.

62
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,333
Why?

63
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,076
It's just I don't know
many heterosexual men who read Heat.

64
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,736
What? He's gay

65
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:36,168
just because he reads Heat magazine?

66
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,215
Well, he's either gay
or a woman in her early twenties.

67
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,207
No, no, no!

68
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:45,371
Why else would he ask me out on a date?

69
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,239
Are you sure he meant it
as a date "date"?

70
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,236
Are you sure you're not going along
as his gal pal?

71
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:54,757
If you're talking about
who I think you're talking about,

72
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:56,759
then the answer is yes, he is gay.

73
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,390
How do you know?

74
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,736
Everyone knows. And once more,

75
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:03,714
he's been gay, since Wham.

76
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,889
We were talking about Philip!

77
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:11,792
He borrowed Heat.

78
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:13,309
He borrowed Heat?

79
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,217
And he knows people in the theatre.

80
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,841
That's not a euphemism. He actually
does know people in the theatre.

81
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:24,612
Anyway, it's a date. I'm sure it is.

82
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:26,430
Why else would he ask me out?

83
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,175
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but...

84
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,116
could he have thought you were a man?

85
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:37,150
– Let's get a taxi.
– It's a ten minute walk.

86
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:38,740
No. I don't like walking.

87
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,540
Why do you just not come,
then you wouldn't have to walk anywhere?

88
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,189
I won't spoil your romantic evening
with the gay man.

89
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:45,495
He's not a gay man!

90
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:46,937
He reads Heat!

91
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,531
Hey, where are you lot off to?

92
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:51,322
Look! Richmond's still alive!

93
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,054
We're going to the theatre.
Do you wanna come?

94
00:04:55,972 --> 00:04:57,683
No, thanks. And you shouldn't go either.

95
00:04:57,824 --> 00:04:58,636
Why not?

96
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,051
A new wind is blowing!

97
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:06,804
Last night, I was stood from my slumber
by a crow calling three times.

98
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,766
Well, you know what a crow sounds like.

99
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,452
Passing to my window,

100
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,164
I trod on a piece of Lego.

101
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:19,017
Oh, it went right in the heel!

102
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:21,923
Turning on my television set,

103
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,723
I noticed the reception wasn't great.

104
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,541
Not terrible, just not great.

105
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:27,699
Hear me well!

106
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,129
No good can come of your trip
to the theatre tonight!

107
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,611
No good at all!

108
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,926
And if you ask me...

109
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:38,781
That's just bloody rude!

110
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:42,592
Where is my Heat?

111
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:52,623
A gay musical,

112
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,299
called Gay.

113
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,035
That's quite gay...

114
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,310
Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay?

115
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,460
This must be like the gayest musical
ever made!

116
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,133
It's got some pretty good reviews!

117
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:16,406
"The story of a young man
trying to find his sexuality

118
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,385
"in the uncaring Thatcher years.

119
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:22,421
"Warning. Includes scenes
of graphic homo eroticism."

120
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,417
Oh no!

121
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,516
It's set in the 80's!

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,468
Graphic homo eroticism?

123
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,128
Are they gonna get them out?

124
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:33,036
You're not comfortable
with your sexuality?

125
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,675
I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

126
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,518
I don't wanna be slapped in the face
with their sexuality.

127
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:39,550
Look! There is Philip!

128
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,836
Look! He's leching at that lady!

129
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,194
Thank God for that!

130
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:45,453
He's just an ordinary ignored man!

131
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,034
Hey! You're already here!

132
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:53,192
What are we doing, Roy? This isn't us.

133
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,557
It takes place in the past!

134
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:56,828
Forget the play.

135
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,565
Philip knows the cast!

136
00:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,704
It's all about the backstage party
afterwards.

137
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:02,027
Those things are great.

138
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:03,943
You go to them telling
they were brilliant

139
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,470
and it's free wine all night.

140
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,411
Besides, I really wanna meet
Laura Nightly.

141
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,697
Hey there, guys!

142
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,050
It's great, isn't it?

143
00:07:13,544 --> 00:07:15,396
Great. We should really pick up
our tickets.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,731
I know someone who gets the tickle!

145
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,590
Sorry, I love doing that to him!

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,820
This is Jerome.
He does publicity for the show.

147
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,144
He got us our tickets.

148
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,291
Great, thanks.

149
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,338
This is Jen, and Moss and Roy.

150
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,614
How is it going?

151
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,132
My God, you're Irish!

152
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:40,437
I love Irish people!

153
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,916
They're just mad, aren't they?
They're just mad!

154
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,096
We're all insane, yeah.

155
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,966
You'll love this!

156
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:48,625
It's great crack!

157
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,367
I'm mad for crack!

158
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,755
Quick everyone!
The show's about to start!

159
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,906
I hope Laura Nightly isn't gonna be
dressed up like toyer or something.

160
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,809
– Who is she in The Bill again?
– She plays that heroin addict

161
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,605
who gets stabbed in the face?
– She is lovely.

162
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,946
Isn't she lovely?

163
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:17,958
Oh God, here we go.

164
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:19,688
It might be right.

165
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:22,799
How bad can it be?

166
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,118
Welcome...

167
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,666
to the United...

168
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,920
Queendom!

169
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,197
Brilliant!

170
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,479
United Queendom!

171
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,720
He can't say that, can he?

172
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:02,297
Yeah! Yeah!

173
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,402
Yeah! Check that asses!

174
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,026
I'm a friend of Dorothy!

175
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,721
I'm a friend of Dorothy!

176
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:14,429
She is my friend!

177
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:17,564
This is insanely brilliant!

178
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:24,560
Hold my hand.

179
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:27,793
No,

180
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,957
that's not my hand!

181
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,444
I love willies!

182
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:41,870
Okay, I'm completely satisfied!

183
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,935
Don't leave! It's rude!

184
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,582
It's too gay for me. I thought
I could handle it, but I can't.

185
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,125
There'll be the interval soon.

186
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,610
I'm captivated, Roy.

187
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:52,414
Calm down.
At least, it can't get any worse.

188
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,527
All right, get them houselights up

189
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:59,210
and let's have a look at you!

190
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:01,611
Are you wearing that shirt for a bet?

191
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,834
Audience participation! Go, go!

192
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,718
What have we...

193
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,854
here!
– Hello!

194
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:13,619
Tell me! Who wears the trousers
in this relationship?

195
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,495
What? Oh, no.

196
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,180
We're not homosexuals.

197
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:19,830
We're just very good friends.

198
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,294
So, you never had a look?

199
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,091
– At what?
– His bob!

200
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,847
I've seen it,

201
00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:28,890
when he thrusts it in front of my desk,

202
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,705
or, should he bend over
to pick something up.

203
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,638
I'd love to work in that office...

204
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:37,310
There's nothing sexual going on.

205
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:40,381
I do like Roy, but I'm not "curious".

206
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,111
What were you engaging him for?

207
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,942
He was asking me questions,
I couldn't just ignore him.

208
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,284
It's a bit rude, Roy.

209
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,987
So what do you think of it?

210
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:52,681
I think it's fabulous.

211
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,957
Every value I've ever held
is being questioned,

212
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,422
and I'm loving it.

213
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,130
You don't like it, do you?

214
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,718
The songs are good.

215
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,606
No, they're not!

216
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,212
Hum one of the songs.

217
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,243
Willies, willies! I like willies!

218
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,585
It's I love willies.

219
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,100
I love willies!
– Sir, could you keep it down?

220
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,847
– I'm not going back in there!
– Oh yes, you are!

221
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:18,418
No. I'll wait out here for you,

222
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,433
but there's no way
I'm going anywhere near that thing.

223
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,592
You can't leave me alone in there.
I don't know what the hell is going on!

224
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,684
He's laughing like an idiot
at every single gay reference!

225
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,951
– Why didn't he come off for a drink?
– He doesn't wanna miss anything!

226
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:34,339
I need to wee wee.

227
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,095
Yeah, me too.

228
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,085
– What's wrong?
– They've got a toilet guy.

229
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,485
I hate toilet guys!

230
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:47,012
Let's just get over with.

231
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:21,679
Thank you.

232
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,267
Cheers, dude.

233
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,127
– Did you go?
– No. Did you?

234
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:32,702
No! How could I?

235
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,714
Block stood looking at us!

236
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,272
What was that?
It's not my fault he works in a toilet!

237
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,090
– How much did you give him?
– A pound.

238
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:41,790
I just paid a pound
not to go to the toilet.

239
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:43,861
He's a terrible toilet guy!

240
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:46,530
He should work where people
don't want to go to the toilet.

241
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:47,819
I'll use the disabled.

242
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,942
– You can't use the disabled!
– What? Why not?

243
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:52,041
You're not disabled!
You'll get in trouble!

244
00:12:52,853 --> 00:12:55,182
It's not like a parking space, Moss.

245
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,758
I think... I think it's okay, isn't it?

246
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,823
It's okay.
I'm always using the disabled.

247
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:01,541
It's illegal!

248
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:04,323
I don't think so.

249
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,027
You all right in there?

250
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,077
Do you need help?

251
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,277
I'm disabled!

252
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,007
He sounds disoriented.

253
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:45,957
Move back from the door!
- What? No!

254
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:50,857
What are you doing?

255
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,047
Don't panic!

256
00:13:58,507 --> 00:14:00,147
What... What's happening?

257
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,197
Someone's had an accident.

258
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,887
Well, you'd better keep going then.

259
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,517
My God, what happened?

260
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,477
I fell off the toilet.

261
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:17,607
Well, come on. Let's get you upright.

262
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:19,427
Thank you.

263
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:23,777
So, what happened?

264
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,077
– I'm disabled.
– How?

265
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:29,357
How what?

266
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,217
How are you disabled?

267
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:33,927
Leg disabled.

268
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,167
Wait, where's your...
Do you have a wheelchair?

269
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,537
Yes.

270
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:40,737
Where?

271
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:43,997
Stolen!

272
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:46,947
But how did they get in?

273
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:49,827
I don't know!

274
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:52,127
All right. It's gonna be okay.

275
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,127
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

276
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,527
Come on. Give me a hand.
There you go.

277
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,637
There you go, there you go, mate.

278
00:14:58,677 --> 00:15:01,677
All right, you're all right.

279
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:16,097
– Easy, mate.
– Hold him tight that way.

280
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:20,297
Easy.

281
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:23,607
All right. Bring him carefully!

282
00:15:27,607 --> 00:15:29,577
Excuse me! This is a staff toilet!

283
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:31,757
Yes...

284
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,847
I'm staff!

285
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,257
I really am feeling much better.

286
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,597
You can all go, now.

287
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:44,777
We're not going anywhere
until we've got you sorted out.

288
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,997
Here's Paul with the wheelchair.

289
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,857
All right. What?

290
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:54,617
I keep one in the office
for emergencies. Let's get you up!

291
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:57,397
Nice and carefully now.
That's it, there we go.

292
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,667
There we are, there.

293
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,567
Oh, the police!

294
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:06,397
Is everything all right?

295
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:07,677
I'm disabled!

296
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:13,037
– So, someone stole you...
– My wheelchair.

297
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,437
I'm disabled.

298
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:18,797
Some lazy bastard just waltzed in there.

299
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,047
Can you describe him?

300
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,807
– It was all over so quick!
– Just tell me just what you can.

301
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,677
Caucasian male...

302
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:28,837
Bearded.

303
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,957
Red hair...

304
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,127
Glasses.

305
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,657
Possibly disguised, I...

306
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,207
All right, thank you.

307
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:40,297
Do you need any help getting home?

308
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,777
No, I'm fine, I'm with people.

309
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:44,637
Here they are, now!

310
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:46,927
Hey, fellas!

311
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,827
– No, I'll take it from here.
– Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

312
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:52,997
Okay...

313
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,087
Are you slacking off in there?

314
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,547
Go and get changed!

315
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:07,087
Excuse me, sir. Can I have a word?

316
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,757
Amazing! Super powerful!

317
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,087
Thanks.

318
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,547
That...

319
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,497
The grit of it!

320
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:16,927
Five stars!

321
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:19,497
So what did you think?

322
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:22,457
– Of the musical?
– Did you not just love it?

323
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:23,667
Well, no,

324
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,607
sorry.
– Why not?

325
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:26,987
I don't know, just...

326
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,277
Maybe, you have to be...

327
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:30,937
gay.

328
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,007
I loved it!

329
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,287
I guess it's more of a gay thing.

330
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,467
You know, you have to be gay.

331
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,547
A gay man.

332
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:43,737
A homosexual.

333
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,947
But all I know is I loved
every last second of it.

334
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,287
And I'm not...

335
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,447
usually a fan of musicals.

336
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,297
Do you want to meet the cast?

337
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:53,637
Come on!

338
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:56,397
The thing is I have to meet
Moss and Roy.

339
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:22,137
Listen, I told the cast
about what happened,

340
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:24,677
and they told me to get you all
to come back and meet them!

341
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,177
Come on everybody! Off the van!

342
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:38,667
Hey, James!

343
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,507
Wow, Edgar!

344
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,547
Hi!

345
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:44,717
Brilliant!

346
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:46,417
Jeremy!

347
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,777
How do you know all these... young...

348
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,487
good looking men?

349
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,217
You know, just from my route.

350
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:54,827
Hey, Jerome!

351
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:56,147
Come here, you!

352
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:57,667
Great show.

353
00:18:58,017 --> 00:18:59,507
Hello, darling!

354
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:01,237
Listen, I can't talk at the moment.

355
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,647
The disabled are coming for a chat.
Here they are now.

356
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:22,797
He's had quite an evening.

357
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,347
Someone stole his wheelchair.

358
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:27,387
Really?

359
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:30,827
Did you see who it was?

360
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:33,237
Red bearded man.

361
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:37,487
How long have you been disabled?

362
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:41,547
– Ten years.
– Ten years!

363
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,697
And how did it happen,
if that's not a rude question?

364
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,247
Acid.

365
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,937
What are the chances
of that happening?

366
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,237
A hundred to one.

367
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:00,137
– You're like you could do with a drink.
– Whisky.

368
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:01,957
Please. Double.

369
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:03,977
– Excuse me?
– Yes, miss?

370
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:17,247
Can I have a double whisky, please?

371
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,547
Double whisky.

372
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:20,107
And a glass of white wine.

373
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:21,417
A glass of white wine.

374
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:22,717
Thank you.

375
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,437
You're very welcome, madam.

376
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,777
Hello!

377
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,897
– Hello, Laura Nightly.
– How are you?

378
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:41,787
I'm disabled!

379
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,897
It must be so difficult
being gay and disabled.

380
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,557
Very difficult.

381
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,627
Come here, my little soldier.

382
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:57,387
– What's the matter?
– I don't know.

383
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:01,677
– You're from telly!
– I am.

384
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:06,127
And you know, a little birdy told me
that you couldn't make the show tonight.

385
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:08,517
So, I've got you two tickets
for tomorrow.

386
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,647
Brilliant!

387
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:15,047
– You're doing so well!
– Yeah.

388
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:16,907
– High five!
– High five!

389
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:18,647
Laura!

390
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,367
A couple of photos?

391
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,227
Is he from a newspaper?

392
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,897
– Yes, he's from The Standard.
– Oh, God!

393
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,197
What... What's...

394
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,177
I get it!

395
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,857
Very funny, you Irish!

396
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,177
I'm a bit tired!
Can I have a wheelchair too?

397
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:40,317
Hilarious!

398
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:43,027
Me legs don't work!

399
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,197
Help, pal! I need a wheelchair!

400
00:21:45,357 --> 00:21:47,427
Come on, get out! Come on!

401
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,797
Stop buzzing around, all right, Gary?

402
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,477
Well, I guess this is good night.

403
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,777
For God sake, are you gay?
Are you a gay man?

404
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:18,327
No!

405
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:19,357
– Are you?
– No!

406
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:20,957
So brilliant, dude! That's...

407
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:23,147
'Cause that's all I wanted to know.
I don't mind,

408
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,337
one way or another, you know.
it's just I like...

409
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,147
being clear. I don't want any...

410
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:28,897
ambiguity.

411
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,037
What on earth made you think I was gay?

412
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,237
Well, you know... I didn't just...

413
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:35,887
pull it out of the air.

414
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,407
You know, you just brought me
to a gay musical called Gay,

415
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,707
You've been laughing like mad
at every...

416
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:43,857
at every gay reference. Your friends,

417
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,307
more of whom are gay,

418
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,477
say hello by tickling you!

419
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:52,107
In what century are you living in?
Do you think

420
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:54,927
that a man has to be gay
to like a gay musical?

421
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:57,757
Can a straight man
not have homosexual friends?

422
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,877
And since when was tickling gay?

423
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:02,807
I missed that meaning, Jen!

424
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:06,497
Come here.
– I'm sorry, I guess

425
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:08,647
you astray me when you borrowed
that copy of Heat.

426
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,447
Oh God, it's true,

427
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,037
it's true, I'm gay!

428
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:15,047
I'm a gay man!
I tried to run from it tonight

429
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,267
but I can't, I can't!

430
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:20,197
Jen, what am I gonna do?

431
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:24,307
I thought
I could make it work between us,

432
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,927
because you looked a bit like a man!

433
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,037
Taxi!

434
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:00,517
Hello, there.

435
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:03,817
I didn't see you on the way out.

436
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:07,537
All right, lads!
Let's get a sing song coming!

437
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,657
It's a long way back to Manchester!

438
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:18,187
Willies! Willies! I love willies!

439
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,917
– 'Night, Steve.
– 'Night, Moss.

440
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,577
– 'Night Melly, you be good!
– Mind if I can't help it.

441
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:32,537
Ah, the theatre....
