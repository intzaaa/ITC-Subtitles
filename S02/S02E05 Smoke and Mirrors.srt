1
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:06,837
Morning, beautiful.

2
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:13,731
Course, I'll send someone up
as soon as I can, OK? Bye.

3
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:18,225
You're very late,

4
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,045
it's been crazy down here.
We've had a call.

5
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:22,576
Sorry.

6
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:23,725
Oh, God! Oh.

7
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,986
Are you all right?

8
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:28,347
Are you poorly?

9
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,783
No, it's just, it's just a bad bra.

10
00:01:31,293 --> 00:01:34,234
It's the only one I had handy
this morning and it's really terrible,

11
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:35,888
it's pinching into my sides

12
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,122
and the straps
are digging into my shoulders.

13
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:41,135
All that and it's not even
giving my breasts proper support!

14
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,646
It's killing me.

15
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,667
Oh, Moss.

16
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,805
Oh, I'm sorry, are you OK?
– What happened?

17
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,326
Sometimes I forget I'm not
just working with other women.

18
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:56,823
No, it's my fault, I really ought
to be able to listen

19
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,781
to a woman talking about bras without...

20
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:03,790
Hello, good morning, here I am.
Here we go.

21
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:07,425
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, the first time
I wasn't expecting you

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,452
to start talking about bras and then,

23
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:12,072
the second time,
it just came as a bit of surprise

24
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,731
to hear myself talking about them.

25
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:16,135
It's been a rollercoaster.

26
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:18,720
Why don't you just have
a lie down in there?

27
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,650
Morning.

28
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,799
Morning.

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,267
God, I feel rough.

30
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:31,567
Good stag?

31
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,525
Yeah, you know, standard stag.

32
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:38,243
I may have got a little bit drunk
towards the end there.

33
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,028
Oh, well what kind of celebration

34
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,741
would it be if you
didn't pass out at some point?

35
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:46,108
Yeah, thank God nobody noticed.

36
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,033
How do you know I passed out?

37
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:52,341
I'm a bit psychic sometimes,
and I bet you came straight from

38
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:53,910
the party as well, didn't you?

39
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,373
Oh, that's easy, I'm wearing
the same clothes.

40
00:02:58,203 --> 00:03:00,181
Roy, I was trying to remember how

41
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,113
that song goes, The Locomotion,
do you remember that song?

42
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,309
– Yeah, course I remember.
– How's it go again?

43
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,969
You know it, you must know it.

44
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:10,751
No, no, no.

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,454
It is a funny song.

46
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,120
– You all right there?
– Yep,

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,437
it's just a bad bra.

48
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,586
Right,

49
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,947
I have got to go,

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,889
heads of department meeting.

51
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,673
After last week's fiasco,
I need to make a good impression.

52
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:44,630
We didn't think you'd believe us.

53
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,992
If you'd just stopped
to think about it for one second

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,078
you'd have realised that it wasn't true.

55
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,179
I don't think that's true.

56
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:55,924
With all due respect,
John, I am Head of IT.

57
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,538
And I have it on good authority.

58
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:00,602
If you type Google

59
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,645
into Google,

60
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:05,705
you can break the Internet,

61
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,386
so please...

62
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,145
no-one try it,

63
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,853
even for a joke.

64
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:18,408
It's not a laughing matter,
you can break the Internet.

65
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:22,843
You don't know what those meetings
are like, they are murder.

66
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,099
It does you no harm to look a
little foolish from time to time.

67
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:30,118
Roy, there's...
something I should let you know.

68
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:31,540
What?

69
00:04:31,765 --> 00:04:33,328
Stephanie called earlier.

70
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:35,630
Douglas needs someone
to take a look at his computer.

71
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,688
No, no, no, no, no,
get Moss to do it.

72
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,008
Oh, Moss isn't feeling too well
and besides, of the two of you,

73
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,774
you're the expert.

74
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,368
The Ordinary Boys,

75
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:54,645
where do they get these crazy names?

76
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,277
Entrare.

77
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,585
I'm Roy, IT.

78
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,668
My computer's,
my computer's broken...

79
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,583
I have to say that's
a really wild look.

80
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:12,259
You know, things are moving
just so fast, I can't keep up.

81
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:14,897
First, The Ordinary Boys,
and now this.

82
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,206
Should I check it out?

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,687
Great, yeah.

84
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:25,407
Let's get started, shall we?

85
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:26,715
What?

86
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,343
What needs my expertise?

87
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,130
You did say you were
with IT, didn't you?

88
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,704
Yeah.

89
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,771
Come on, Mr Renow, while I'm down here.
I may as well get to work.

90
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,944
OK, I'm gonna move over here.

91
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,838
Sure.

92
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:47,313
I can see where
you've been having problems.

93
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,722
See, this isn't actually a computer.

94
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,403
It's a brief case.

95
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:54,016
– Excellent.
– I'll have one sent up.

96
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:01,930
I admire you, Roy.

97
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,504
You've got the guts to stand
up in what you believe in.

98
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,887
OK, see you then.

99
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,567
Good luck.

100
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:19,515
Which means that we now have

101
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:22,439
the cleanest toilets of any legal
department in London.

102
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:23,865
Thank you.

103
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:25,519
Well done, James,

104
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:28,589
you managed to speak for eight minutes
without actually saying anything.

105
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,413
I think that...
what.

106
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,711
What?

107
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,364
No, nothing.

108
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:38,806
Who's next? Right, Jen, OK,
what's going on down in middle earth?

109
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:44,799
Thank you, John, and,
prepare to be astonished

110
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:47,259
because I have discovered four ways

111
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:51,943
to increase our online visibility
without spending a single penny.

112
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,036
Number one...

113
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,417
Excuse me, sorry...

114
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,595
Number one...

115
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,507
Number one...

116
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:13,244
You bloody thing.

117
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:14,925
For God's sake!

118
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:19,028
Bloody thing,
bloody pain in the arse.

119
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,133
I'm a woman.

120
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,943
It's really pinching my sides,

121
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,262
the straps are digging
into my shoulders.

122
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,195
Eh, Moss, look, I'm a woman.

123
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,900
And I love you, Moss, I love you.

124
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,964
The straps are digging
into my shoulders.

125
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:57,283
They're not giving my breasts
proper support,

126
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:00,349
proper support, proper support.

127
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,903
Hang on a second.

128
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,405
Hang on a second.

129
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,402
I've done it.

130
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:48,516
I've done it.

131
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,734
– Hello.
– Hello, Jen.

132
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:57,867
Who is this?

133
00:08:58,203 --> 00:08:59,799
That's not important right now.

134
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,677
Well, it says Moss on my phone.

135
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,908
Yes, all right, it's me.

136
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,613
Why are you disguising your voice?

137
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:13,358
Because if someone is listening
in on this conversation,

138
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,654
I don't want them to know
my identity.

139
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,356
But they know now.

140
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,271
Yes, thanks.

141
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:23,375
So why don't you use
your normal voice, now?

142
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:27,035
It's attached to the phone,
I'd have to hang up...

143
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,419
Look, just listen to me.

144
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,413
Why don't you just
come in and speak to me?

145
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,423
You're ruining...
You're ruining everything.

146
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:35,104
What do you want, Moss?

147
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:36,997
Take your top off, Jen.

148
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,834
Sorry?

149
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:41,820
You heard me, take your top off.

150
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,153
– What's this all about anyway?
– You'll see.

151
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,510
Is this another one
of your inventions?

152
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,574
Maybe.

153
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,886
What was the last one?
Oh, yeah.

154
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:07,604
A ladder to help moths
escape from the bath.

155
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:09,552
How's that useful?

156
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:10,935
How's that not useful?

157
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,221
Moths don't get stuck in baths.

158
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,902
Yes, they do.

159
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,413
Even if that were true,

160
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:23,339
it's just not in their nature
to learn how to use a ladder.

161
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,062
They have wings.

162
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:31,064
When a moth thinks about
travelling vertically upwards,

163
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:33,932
a ladder

164
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,038
is just the last thing
they would think of.

165
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,134
Moss, I don't like
to be negative about it, but...

166
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,433
everything you invent is worthless.

167
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:48,020
Ah, well, prepare to put mustard
on those words,

168
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,807
for you will soon be consuming them,

169
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:52,693
along with this slice of humble pie

170
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,608
that comes direct
from the oven of shame

171
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:58,097
set at gas mark egg-on-your-face.

172
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,745
I sort of forget
what I was talking about.

173
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:09,461
Ah, here's Jen. Oh, that's it,
it's a bra. I've made a brilliant bra.

174
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:11,886
How are ye?

175
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,469
Is it, er, comfortable?

176
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:18,802
This is possibly the most
comfortable bra I have ever worn.

177
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,491
Donning clothes over a bad bra

178
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,767
is like building a house
without laying a foundation.

179
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,406
It's just a false economy
and an ill-fitting bra

180
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:29,432
could well ruin your otherwise
painstakingly-selected ensemble.

181
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,693
You really know your stuff.

182
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,117
– Thank you.
– Google?

183
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,449
Jen, Roy, bad bras are more
than just a nuisance,

184
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:40,886
they're a menace.

185
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,301
Years of wearing a bad bra

186
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,672
can contribute to upper back
and shoulder pain.

187
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,438
It can even lead to headaches.

188
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,453
So what makes this bra different?.

189
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,921
It can never go bad.

190
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,326
What do you mean?

191
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:56,201
Tiny elements of fissilca rub
together to prevent the fabric

192
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,456
from resting too long
in any one position.

193
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,350
It's a living bra.

194
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:04,627
The effect would be rather like
having a large pair of man's hands

195
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,350
holding the breasts in position.

196
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:10,847
But the bra will go bad,
all bras go bad.

197
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:14,570
Not this one, Jen. But don't take my
word for it, take it out for a spin.

198
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:16,208
So what's it called?

199
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:19,017
I call it the Abracada-bra!

200
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,142
You are kidding me.

201
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,630
– No.
– You're really going on Dragons' Den?

202
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:31,173
I've got an interview today
with the producers at the BBC.

203
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:35,109
Oh, that is just huge.
You're gonna be on telly.

204
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,977
But you've got to keep
this under your respective hats

205
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,849
so if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Jennal.

206
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:42,360
Why Stephen Jennal?

207
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:44,932
If my calculations are correct,
this could be the only bra

208
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,235
a woman need ever buy.

209
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:49,372
Do you know what Playtexwould do to me
if they knew about the Abracada-bra?

210
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:50,657
what would they do?

211
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,977
They would kill me.

212
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,786
I don't know
if they'd kill you, Moss.

213
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,084
Playtex have changed
a lot over the last few years.

214
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,515
Nonetheless,
I want complete secrecy on this one,

215
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,970
so if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Fennal.

216
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,140
I chose Stephen Fennal
because it's easy to remember.

217
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:12,534
Right. Except, well, you did
say Stephen Jennal earlier.

218
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:16,215
Smoke and mirrors, Roy.
Is it Fennel? Is it Jennal?

219
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,081
If I don't know, how will they?

220
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,549
Who am I, Roy?
I'm a ghost. I'm a shadow. I'm gone.

221
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,734
Hello, Moss speaking.

222
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,168
Well done, good presentation.

223
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,365
– Thanks, James.
– Jen, a word.

224
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:41,549
Got Helen Bewley coming in tomorrow.
Do you know who she is?

225
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,719
Of course I do.

226
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,847
She's just been made
head of BHDR Industries,

227
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:46,709
so obviously we need to make friends.

228
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:50,069
I know, BHDR Industries,
they're the top makers of that product

229
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,037
that has something
to do with our company.

230
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,229
Exactly.

231
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,216
I want you up front at that meeting.

232
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:57,897
We can't have Helen going back
to BHDR saying Renham Industries

233
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,189
is just a boys' club.

234
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:01,018
– How does that sound?
– Sounds great.

235
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:02,683
All right, see you tomorrow.

236
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:12,803
Stephen Premmal?

237
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:15,482
Oh, hello. Yeah, I'm Stephen Premmal.

238
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,450
I think.

239
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,892
You're very late. Quick.

240
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,072
Hello, Stephen Premmel.
I'm afraid I'm very late.

241
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,737
What exactly, um, is...?

242
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,549
Gavin Briers here with
developments in North Korea.

243
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:37,762
It's five years
since the war in Iraq began.

244
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,662
The conflict rages on with
no hope of a solution in sight.

245
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,683
I'm joined by Stephen Premmel,

246
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,067
a spokesman for
the Ministry of Defence. Mr Premmel?

247
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,842
Hello.

248
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:52,502
Iraq is a gigantic
and bloody mess, isn't it?

249
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:54,339
Yes.

250
00:14:58,414 --> 00:14:59,783
Well, how do you explain it?

251
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:01,626
Well, we shouldn't have gone to war.

252
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,148
You think the original
invasion was a mistake?

253
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:05,400
Oh, yes.

254
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:07,691
I'm astonished you
should agree to this so readily

255
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,947
when your department
must take a lot of the blame.

256
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,079
What? We didn't do anything.

257
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,504
You raised no objection
in the run up to the war.

258
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:19,082
Yes, I did. I signed a petition.

259
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,367
Sorry?

260
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,554
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
When can I start talking about my bra?

261
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,343
Jen, can you bring me
the prototype when you're ready?

262
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,777
There are a couple
of glitches I need to iron out.

263
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,182
Sure.
Guess who I'm about to meet now.

264
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:38,224
Helen Bewley.

265
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,930
Oh, come on. She took
that football team to court

266
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,526
for institutional sexism,
won massive damages,

267
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,999
and now she's Head CEO
at BHDR Industries.

268
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,838
It's all right. I kinda switched off
after the word football.

269
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,836
Did you see it? Is he in?

270
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:56,144
Is he...?

271
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,798
There I am,

272
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:07,202
catching up with the news events
of the day,

273
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:10,765
when who should appear
upon my television screen?

274
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,404
It's only the Ministry of Defence.

275
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:18,329
The news, Dragons' Den,
you're all over the schedules.

276
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,264
I'm sorry, Moss, are you really sure
you're ready to go on Dragons' Den?

277
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,243
Yes, it's a brilliant product.

278
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,632
Don't get me wrong.
You have got the science down

279
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,970
but it's all the other stuff,
isn't it?

280
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:33,217
– What other stuff?
– OK, well...

281
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:37,745
OK, well, let's say this staple
is science,

282
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:39,596
you're good at this.

283
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,619
What you're not so good at

284
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,333
is everything else in the world.

285
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,120
That's where I come in.

286
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,731
I can help you
with all this other stuff,

287
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:53,281
you know, give you some
tips on business and presentation,

288
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:56,587
leaving you free
to concentrate on this.

289
00:16:57,353 --> 00:16:59,041
– What's in it for you?
– A cut.

290
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,781
All right,
you're in for half a percent.

291
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:05,149
25%.

292
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:06,936
Half a percent.

293
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:09,830
Deal.

294
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:12,799
OK, first thing we need to do

295
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,649
is buy the rights
for the word Abracada-bra.

296
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:19,062
Agreed, but before that, we've got
to sort out the overheating problem.

297
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:20,530
Overheating problem?

298
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:24,331
Yes, it's got a very,
very, serious overheating problem.

299
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:27,842
I'll have it sorted by next week.
Just need to get it back off Jen.

300
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:32,402
Which has lead to significant gains

301
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:36,919
in this area
and an overall yield of 22%.

302
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,668
Thank you very much. Jen, is it?

303
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,625
Yes, Miss Bewley.

304
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,221
Please, Helen.

305
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,997
As the only 2 women in the room, we can
dispense with formalities, don't you?

306
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,680
Renham Industries has come a
long way in the past few years

307
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:56,227
if a young woman like this
can blossom within its walls.

308
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,358
I remember when the atmosphere here
here was a lot less conducive

309
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:03,280
to what I can remember
one executive calling «working skirt».

310
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:07,393
Yes. Well, I think we're all a little
older and a little wiser now, Helen.

311
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,776
One would hope so.

312
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:13,160
Are you OK, Jen?

313
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,479
My tits.

314
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:20,804
Oh, my tits are hot.

315
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,655
They're really, really hot.

316
00:18:25,246 --> 00:18:26,736
Oh, my tits are on fire.

317
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:28,566
Yep, my tits are on fire.

318
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,083
They are on fire.
My tits are on fire!

319
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,825
Oh, yeah! All right!

320
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:38,129
– 40%.
– 20%.

321
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:39,810
40.

322
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:45,626
You owe me. Helen Bewley
has gone away thinking I was a stripper

323
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:47,978
hired as a prank.

324
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,595
But 40%, Jen, be reasonable.

325
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,650
I have two black rings around here.

326
00:18:54,225 --> 00:18:56,246
I could sue you and get everything.

327
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:58,546
– All right, all right.
– Good, thank you.

328
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,982
Now, I can concentrate
on your presentation.

329
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,175
– I'm doing presentation.
– Where did you get pizza?

330
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:06,825
Some idiot left it in the toilet.

331
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,661
I am doing presentation.

332
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,551
No, hold on. Moss is my best friend,
and I'm damned if I'm...

333
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,319
– Do something else.
– Like what?

334
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,702
I don't know. Fitness.

335
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,255
Fitness?!

336
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,950
People do need to be fit
to go on Dragons' Den.

337
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:19,282
Come on, Moss,
you're keeping the dragons waiting.

338
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,133
Hey, Jen, Roy.

339
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:23,570
You look amazing.

340
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:24,868
Thank you.

341
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:26,974
And you sorted out the
overheating problem?

342
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,177
I'm completely sure that
I've absolutely sorted out

343
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,028
the overheating problem, yes.

344
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:34,378
Unless I've made it even worse.

345
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:37,059
How do you feel? Do you feel ready?

346
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,547
My middle name is ready.
No, that doesn't sound right.

347
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:42,553
I eat ready for breakfast.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,907
OK, maybe don't talk too much.
Let the product do the talking.

349
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,673
What do I do
when they want me to do the talking?

350
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:52,022
– You're scaring him.
– Don't be scared, Moss.

351
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,341
This is one of the biggest
moments of your life.

352
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,294
You cannot get
nervous now because if you do, Moss,

353
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,060
it'll be a disaster, a disaster!

354
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,867
Shut up!

355
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,527
I don't want to do it.
I feel trapped, like a moth in a bath.

356
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,962
Moss, we're already late.

357
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:13,871
Will you come on with me?

358
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:16,843
– What?
– Please.

359
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:20,311
Oh, actually,
maybe it's just the thing.

360
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:24,497
If Helen Bewley sees it, she'll realise
I'm a proper professional,

361
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,368
and not a member
of the sex industry. You sure?

362
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,006
I'm positive.
You can do presentation.

363
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,267
And I'll do fitness.

364
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:38,681
Jen, Roy and Morris are IT
professionals with Renham Industries.

365
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,480
They walk up the stairs

366
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,012
and across the room.

367
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:44,526
They nod at the dragons.

368
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,023
One of them, Morris,
puts a case on a chair.

369
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,724
The dragons are beside
piles of money, with pens.

370
00:21:55,362 --> 00:21:57,586
Women in the workplace...

371
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,300
Take your time.

372
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:09,505
Women working
in a workplace environment...

373
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:14,504
work in workplaces...

374
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,219
where they work...

375
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:21,859
and as a woman,

376
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:24,694
and as a woman, as a worker,

377
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,806
as a woman worker who...

378
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,210
works in the workplace...

379
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:34,763
Sorry, bit of asthma.

380
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:14,391
We are looking for £400,000 for 2%.
We'd welcome your questions.

381
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:30,180
Wow, this music sounds like
it comes from space.

382
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:32,306
– Yeah, mate.
– It does.

383
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:34,285
Ordinary boys they ain't.

384
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,861
I'm having a good time. Yeah.

385
00:23:42,244 --> 00:23:44,159
This is good, good shit.
