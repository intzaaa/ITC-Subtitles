1
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,443
And then Peter said, «Brie,

2
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:36,068
«that's my favourite cheese as well.»

3
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:38,821
And that was when my bag...
I don't know what happened,

4
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:40,855
it just kind of split open.

5
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:42,737
Apples and oranges everywhere.

6
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,621
And we tumbled about.

7
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,318
Yeah. Like a pair of
confused little kittens.

8
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,537
And when Peter had helped me
pick everything up, well...

9
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,788
it just seemed rude not
to give him my number.

10
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,847
Hey, you asked for my number!

11
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,501
I'm not a slut.

12
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,190
Oh, is that the end of the story?

13
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,452
OK, are we all set for tonight?

14
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,818
Yes. Can you please bring me some wine?

15
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,552
That was some...

16
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:25,239
Buying the same sort of cheese!

17
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,456
You made a 20-minute story
out of it.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,713
Have you thought of adapting it
into a film?

19
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,801
No.

20
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,179
Well done, you've bagged a normal.

21
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,529
Yes.

22
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:42,374
He is proper normal, isn't he?

23
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,820
He's taking me to Paris this weekend.

24
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:46,585
Ah, Paris...

25
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,857
– Have you been to Paris, Moss?
– No.

26
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:51,532
No. I've heard of it.

27
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:54,932
– Brie?
– Yeah, what?

28
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,434
Nothing. I had you down
a Double-Gloucester-type person.

29
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,003
Yes, I know what you mean.

30
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,744
It's been ages
since I had a mini-break.

31
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,226
Not only that but all of my friends
are single

32
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,415
and so are all of his,
so tonight, we're gonna have

33
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:16,286
a big dinner party and...
It's gonna be brilliant.

34
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,788
Or perhaps that should be «brie-lliant».

35
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:28,909
Do you know, it is really
important to me that you like him.

36
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:30,407
No, honestly, it is...

37
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:34,312
I know we had some rocky beginnings
but I really think of you now

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,867
not just as my workmates,
but as friends.

39
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:40,334
– Stop it!
– No, I... I mean that.

40
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,555
I really do.

41
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,628
You're really important to me.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,930
Listen, Jen, I've got some bad news,
Colin can't make it tonight.

43
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,656
Oh. But Steve and Jake
are still coming?

44
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:58,386
Colin was bringing them.
I don't know them well,

45
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,463
it'd be uncomfortable without Colin.

46
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,246
I suppose we'll have to call
the whole thing off.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Unless you can find
three guys to replace them.

48
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:23,299
I... Bit of dust.

49
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:24,894
I'm gonna...

50
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,093
... definitely later phone the...

51
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:33,158
Strange... Oh, look at that...

52
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,646
Oh, I can't... I can't...

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,294
It's my home, it's my special place,

54
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,623
I can't let you nut-jobs
into my special place!

55
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,075
«Nut-jobs»?
I hope you're not including me in that.

56
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,435
Wait a second, we were all
«brilliant friends» a minute ago.

57
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:57,467
Yes, yes,
I meant friends in a different way,

58
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:02,879
in a kind of special way that
means you can't come into my home.

59
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:07,822
Right, so sort of like
not being your friends at all.

60
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:12,072
Yes, yes, sort of like that
but in a really special way.

61
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,540
This is your lowest moment, you know.

62
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,126
I think I can live with it.

63
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,117
Roy, can you look at my PC, please?

64
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:28,045
It keeps freezing.

65
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,846
Did you hear something, Moss?
I thought I heard a noise.

66
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,587
I didn't hear anything, Roy. Unless
it was some kind of stupid mouse.

67
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,542
Yeah, or...  Or a rat.

68
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:45,280
Yes, I think it did sound more
like a rat.

69
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,946
I know I was horrible. I'm sorry.

70
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:52,655
Richmond...

71
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:56,113
Oh, Richmond, not you too.

72
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:57,929
I'm sorry, Richmond...

73
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,477
Hello!

74
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,788
I smell food!

75
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,913
What are you doing? Don't sit down yet.

76
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:34,401
Why not? I'm tired.

77
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,850
That's the rules.
We stand around a bit first.

78
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,769
– We have drinks.
– Where's Peter?

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,152
In the kitchen.

80
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:44,283
– Can I go to the toilet?
– Yes, you may. You don't need to ask.

81
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,573
It's just down there to the left.

82
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,439
There you go.

83
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,587
Thank you, Roy.

84
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,533
How lovely. White wine.

85
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:57,015
Never seen a wine actually called
«White Wine».

86
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,933
– Thank you, Roy. What are you drinking?
– Red wine, please.

87
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,997
– Richmond?
– Do you have absinthe?

88
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,299
– No.
– I only drink absinthe.

89
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,444
Absinthe, no.
Red wine, white wine, Carlsberg?

90
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:11,850
Carlsberg, perfect.

91
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,192
That was quick.

92
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:15,595
I washed my hands!

93
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,894
– What do you want to drink?
– White Russian.

94
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,607
A white Russian?

95
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,319
Oh, for God's sake!

96
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:29,698
Documentaries...

97
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:37,461
Balsamic vinegar...

98
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:41,403
Conversation...

99
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,476
I heard one of Jen's friends
is a model.

100
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:45,878
I bagsy the model!

101
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,006
We discussed it as a group,

102
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:54,516
and we think it would be best
if I were to sit beside the model...

103
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,422
Because...

104
00:06:57,362 --> 00:07:00,540
I would like to ask her how I would
go about becoming a photographer.

105
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,519
Or... a model.

106
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:03,882
Paula?

107
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:05,912
She'll appreciate that.

108
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,011
She's just had reconstructive
face surgery

109
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,516
so she'll be happy
to have someone to talk to.

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,210
Right.

111
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,295
It's really brave of her to come out

112
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,722
because she was in
a really bad car accident

113
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:20,620
so you have to be extra nice to her.

114
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:23,132
Car accident.

115
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:24,924
Brilliant. Just my luck.

116
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:28,332
I'll be honest. The reason
I got you round a bit early

117
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,398
is to go over some ground rules, OK?

118
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,434
If this evening is gonna work
in any way,

119
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,911
you need to pretend
to be normal people, yeah?

120
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,939
Keep the conversation about things
that would interest everybody.

121
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,074
You know, nothing about memory
or RAM.

122
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,604
Memory is RAM!

123
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,670
Oh, dear!

124
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,655
If you stray into areas
I don't think appropriate, I'll...

125
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:53,495
I don't know... I'll cough.

126
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,192
Coughing is the signal.
Richmond, did you hear that?

127
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:59,186
– What?
– If Jen coughs we have to stop talking.

128
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:00,673
Fine.

129
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:05,107
Moss, this is important,
I'm sitting you beside Margaret.

130
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,738
Margaret, from her name
I presume she's a lay-dee?

131
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:10,065
Yes.

132
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:13,058
She's nice. She got divorced
recently but I should say

133
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,173
when she's had a few drinks
she tends to get a bit...

134
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:17,614
over excited.

135
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,301
Needs to go to the toilet a lot.
That happens to me.

136
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:23,861
I try to think of something dry,
like the desert or...

137
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,105
Shredded wheat.

138
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:28,801
You don't understand.
What I'm saying is she's kind of...

139
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,786
She's kind of on the look out for a man.

140
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,745
I see. What does he look like?

141
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,983
He wouldn't come here,
not with all these people around.

142
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,357
What's this about?

143
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:43,172
– Jen's friend has got a stalker.
– Cool.

144
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,273
God, maybe I could just kill myself.

145
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,897
Here they are, so look normal.

146
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,040
Look more normal, more normal!

147
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,505
Relax!

148
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,387
Forget it!

149
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,343
Hello. Come in.

150
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,286
Hello. I'm Roy.

151
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:15,353
I'm sorry about the accident.

152
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Hello.

153
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,645
This is Paula.

154
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,330
Yep, I know.

155
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,957
I was talking to her.

156
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,901
Did you think I was talking to you?

157
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,260
This is Jessica.

158
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,436
Hello, everybody!

159
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,507
Oh, my God. Social situations!

160
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,684
Oh, bloody hell, I think this is my one.

161
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,564
These are my workmates.

162
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,363
They're not my usual friends.

163
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,481
I work with them, they're my workmates.

164
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:46,638
Oh, yes.

165
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,997
«IT department... does not compute.»

166
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,490
Oh, my God!

167
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:57,905
– You must be Roy.
– Yep.

168
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:01,522
Hello, everybody!

169
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,943
I have had a few drinks already,
so, no-one take advantage of me.

170
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,793
Oh, go on then!

171
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:26,267
I was very pleased
with my last campaign.

172
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,317
I just started running it today.

173
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:34,117
That's you!

174
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:41,427
So...

175
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:45,007
... how bad was the accident?

176
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,777
Well, a motorbike jumped the lights
and so I swerved into a lamppost.

177
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,477
The airbag didn't deploy
so I hit the dashboard.

178
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:54,037
– With your facial area.
– I hit it full in the face.

179
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:55,607
Of course you did!

180
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,867
Speed?

181
00:10:58,577 --> 00:10:59,967
I was doing about 75.

182
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:03,237
That's fast!

183
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,217
When you regained consciousness,

184
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:10,427
did you look in the mirror and think,

185
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:12,387
«Oh, God, my face is ruined»?

186
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,657
They didn't let me see
my face after the accident.

187
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:19,907
I see.

188
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,337
They said it might not be
as symmetrical as it once had been,

189
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,177
but symmetry isn't everything.

190
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,147
Yeah... I like symmetry.

191
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:32,267
Stop it! Stop it!
I'm trying to eat my dinner!

192
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,007
Gosh. Oh dear!

193
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:40,257
Look at us having a conversation. Yikes!

194
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,407
Getting to know you,
getting to know all about you!

195
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:50,147
Eating! Hello, how are you?

196
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,587
«Oh, I'm a fish.
Help, I'm being eaten!»

197
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:03,727
You know when you laugh,
I can see the outline of your skull.

198
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,057
You have a beautiful skull.

199
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,727
So the surgeon...

200
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,147
– Yeah?
– Good man?

201
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,787
Very. He did his own nose.

202
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,747
And did you meet him
before the operation?

203
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:28,157
Yeah, he ran me through it.
He was really nice.

204
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:30,777
– Confident?
– Why are you so interested?

205
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:33,847
My... mother...

206
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:38,517
is thinking of having
a breast augmentation.

207
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:42,257
– I see.
– Yeah. Always wanted them bigger!

208
00:12:42,537 --> 00:12:45,517
But I promised I'd get them
for her birthday.

209
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:49,227
– Her 60th is coming up.
– Right.

210
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,517
Well, I think a round of applause
is justified for that dinner.

211
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,647
Yes, and thanks, Peter, for making it.

212
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:05,057
So, who's for dessert?

213
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:08,277
– Isn't this dessert?
– No, that's tartare sauce.

214
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:11,487
– Can I have some dessert?
– Yes.

215
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,587
I'll have the tartare sauce.
Stop it! Stop it!

216
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,217
Look how ticklish he is!

217
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,047
– Stop it!
– Come on!

218
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:22,697
Jen, do something about that woman!

219
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,397
– I warned you about her.
– When?

220
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,147
I spent 10 min trying to warn you.

221
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:28,987
I can see why she's divorced.
She's very divorceable.

222
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,677
You can't wait to take her to court
to get rid of her!

223
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,327
What are you doing?

224
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:36,267
Well, not that
it's any of your business,

225
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:38,537
but I was planning to have a little poo.

226
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,247
No, no, I mean with Paula.

227
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:45,337
You keep asking her all those
questions about her accident.

228
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:47,447
– I'm interested!
– You're wondering

229
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:50,087
– what state her face is in.
– Was that obvious?

230
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:53,787
I suppose I better go back in there
and see what Judy Finnegan's up to!

231
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,717
If this keeps on going on
I will divorce her.

232
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,307
You're not married to her.

233
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,357
No, I suppose... I suppose I'm not.

234
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,337
Come on, behave yourselves.

235
00:14:03,557 --> 00:14:05,737
There's still a chance
to save this thing.

236
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,457
Oh... why...

237
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,117
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

238
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:30,947
I said, «Do you think you'd die
if you drank wee?»

239
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,477
I don't know, but it's
a bloody good question.

240
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:38,077
Here's a question – who here
would eat a spider? I would.

241
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:42,797
I ate an eel in New York but I was
on stage so it doesn't count.

242
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,237
Ah, New York, the city of apples.

243
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:50,207
Peter, I got that link
for the Firefox extension.

244
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,887
What's your e-mail address?

245
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,267
– Do you have a pen?
– I'm recording.

246
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,727
It's filepeter@hotmail.com.

247
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,427
«Filepeter»? And why «filepeter»?

248
00:14:59,677 --> 00:15:01,587
Well, File is my second name.

249
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,187
Right, I see. Peter File.

250
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,567
Who's a paedophile?

251
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,577
No, no, his name is Peter File.

252
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,417
His name is paedophile?

253
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:15,837
Don't say it like that!
It sounds like «paedophile».

254
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:19,057
– That what he just said.
– No. «Peter File».

255
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:21,757
– Paedo File?
– PETER... File.

256
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,997
– Who's a paedophile?
– No one.

257
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,447
Right. It just sounds like «paedophile».

258
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:27,727
No, it doesn't.

259
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,687
Does a bit. «Peter File. »

260
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:31,257
«Peter File»? It does.

261
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,467
Yes, I suppose it does!

262
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:41,487
I hadn't noticed so...

263
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,517
It doesn't worry you, does it?

264
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:45,987
No, no.

265
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,237
Of course it doesn't.

266
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:54,867
They say «PED-o-phile» in America.
Maybe you should move to America!

267
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:56,807
He's not moving to America!

268
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,817
Raiders Of The Lost Ark?

269
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,217
Circle Of Friends?

270
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,847
– It's so obvious!
– No speaking!

271
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:10,657
I've been standing here for 10 min.

272
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:13,667
– Where's Richmond and Jessica?
– Pirates Of The Caribbean!

273
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,807
Why Pirates Of The Caribbean?

274
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,747
I don't know but it was a great movie!
Johnny Depp, what a revelation!

275
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:21,857
It's Crash!

276
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:23,937
It's very obviously Crash!

277
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:26,757
Here's a car crashing into another car,

278
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:30,067
there's people screaming
and blood... Oh, Paula!

279
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,697
Let's play Spin The Bottle!

280
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,077
Oh, for God's sake!

281
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,587
– Oh, what?
– Nothing.

282
00:16:37,737 --> 00:16:40,597
– I'm embarrassing him!
– You're making a fool of yourself!

283
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,007
– He's a delicate flower.
– You are drunk!

284
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,357
If you paid more attention to me...

285
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:48,287
Tell me, Margaret, tell us all,

286
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,897
how could we pay
any more attention to you?

287
00:16:51,197 --> 00:16:52,377
You've changed.

288
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,367
You're not the same man I liked
when I came into the party.

289
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,497
We've all changed, Margaret.

290
00:16:58,657 --> 00:16:59,957
We all have.

291
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:16,787
For God's sake!

292
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,867
Night, Jen. Roy's gonna walk me home.

293
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,217
Oh, lovely.

294
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:23,897
It's just in case any kind

295
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,037
of Elephant man mob situation kicks off.

296
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:32,267
Sorry about Margaret,
it won't happen again.

297
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,237
Fiddly-do.

298
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:36,267
Come on, let's get you home.

299
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:40,987
– Goodbye, Jen.
– Bye, Jen.

300
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:42,707
Bye.

301
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:44,707
Oh, my God!

302
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,027
Nightmare! An absolute nightmare.

303
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,447
What do you mean?

304
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,787
Well, I always have this theory
that if you let your work life

305
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:04,057
mix with your personal life,
then somehow, something will go wrong.

306
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:07,537
But nothing has, has it?
I think it all went rather well.

307
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:11,027
They all seemed to pair off. It's what
you want from an evening like this.

308
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,347
I suppose so.

309
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,717
You're gonna have to face the fact

310
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,957
you run a very successful
dinner party, Jen Barber.

311
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,667
You didn't do too badly yourself,
«paedophile».

312
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,577
– Thanks for walking me home.
– That's OK. Goodbye.

313
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:39,087
– You live here?
– Yeah.

314
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,827
That's a big telly.

315
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:47,157
And all the consoles.
You've got all of the consoles.

316
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,137
Why having them all?

317
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:52,157
I'd hate it if a game came out
on one and I couldn't play it

318
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,547
so it's best to get them all.
Don't you think?

319
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,727
I do think.

320
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,967
And a man doesn't live here?

321
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:02,447
No, just me.

322
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,057
I'm gonna gamble.

323
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,307
What?

324
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:16,207
Would you like to come
for a drink some time?

325
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,757
You know, like a date?

326
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,027
What the hell?

327
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,567
Roy, I'm very flattered...

328
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,017
Good. Of course you are. Thursday?

329
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,707
... But you're not my type.

330
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,097
What?

331
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,647
I mean physically.

332
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:31,777
Physically?

333
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:34,687
Hello!

334
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:37,887
I think I can do better.

335
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,227
– Can I have a lend of this?
– No.

336
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:05,067
Listen, Jen.

337
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,927
When we get back, maybe we should
think about, I don't know,

338
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:14,067
moving your stuff over to my place,
vice versa, I don't mind but...

339
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:17,207
I think it's time we moved
onto the next level,

340
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:20,067
– don't you?
– Yes. Yes, definitely.

341
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:22,167
Great.

342
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,317
If there is a Peter File
in the terminal building

343
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,487
could he please make his way to gate 24?

344
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,567
We are looking for a Peter File.

345
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,487
24... we're at the wrong gate!

346
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,317
Could Peter File please make himself
known to ground staff?

347
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,157
I'm Peter File!

348
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:40,297
We are looking for a Peter File.

349
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:41,857
I'm Peter File!

350
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,647
Wait here! I'm Peter File!

351
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:46,367
Hold on! Come on, Jen. I'm Peter File!

352
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,847
It's «Peter File» not «paedophile».

353
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,157
It's very loud, mind if I turn it down?

354
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,097
I wouldn't do that!

355
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:21,617
Oh, dear! Look at me, having an orgasm!
