1
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:46,527
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen,

2
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,607
but I found the best thing to do
with the new employee

3
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,582
is to size them up
with a long hard stare.

4
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:10,732
– So!
– So.

5
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,207
– First day!
– Yes!

6
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,632
– Scary...?
– Yes...

7
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:15,832
– Don't be scared!
– I'm not really scared.

8
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:16,407
You should be!

9
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:18,657
– Well I'm a little bit scared.
– What? Don't be!

10
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:19,657
Make up your mind!

11
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,632
So here you are!

12
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:23,232
Yes.

13
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:24,907
I'm... really looking forward to...

14
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:27,332
– Getting to grips with the...
– I'm gonna put you in I.T.

15
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:30,682
Because you said on your CV you had
a lot of experience with computers.

16
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:35,182
I did say that on my CV yes.

17
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:38,132
I have lots of experience
with the whole...

18
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:41,657
computer... thing you know, e-mails...

19
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:46,357
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails,
deleting e-mails...

20
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,882
– I could go on.
– Do!

21
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,161
The Web... Using mouse...
mices... using mice.

22
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,532
Clicking... double clicking...

23
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:02,807
the computer screen of course,
the keyboard...

24
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:05,332
the bit that goes on the floor
down there...

25
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,632
– The hard drive?
– Correct.

26
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,457
Well, you certainly seem
to know your stuff.

27
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,307
That settles.
Got a good feeling about you Jen!

28
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:13,907
And they need a new manager.

29
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:15,361
Fantastic!

30
00:02:15,397 --> 00:02:17,432
So... the people I'll be working with,
what're they like?

31
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:18,982
Standard nerds!

32
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:08,527
Hello I.T.?

33
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,857
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

34
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,882
OK, well, the button on the side,
is it glowing?

35
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:20,557
Yeah, you need to turn it on!

36
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:24,557
The button, turns it on?!

37
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,205
Yeah... You... Yeah...

38
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,557
You do know how a button works,
don't you?

39
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,632
No, not on clothes!

40
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:35,932
Hello, I.T.?

41
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,957
Yeah?

42
00:03:39,332 --> 00:03:42,307
Have you tried forcing
an unexpected reboot?

43
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:45,032
No, no! There you go! No there you go,
I just heard it come on.

44
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,732
No no, that's the music you hear
when it comes on.

45
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,357
No, that's the music you hear when...

46
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:51,707
I'm sorry, are you from the past?!

47
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:56,157
See the driver hooks a function
by patching the system call table.

48
00:03:56,207 --> 00:03:57,582
So it's not safe to unload it,

49
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:00,207
unless another thread's about
to jump in there and do its stuff.

50
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,557
and you don't want to end up
in middle of invalid memory.

51
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:06,457
Hello?

52
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:11,157
Really? Really, why don't you come
down here and make me then?

53
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:14,007
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!

54
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,757
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for ya!

55
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,332
That told her!

56
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,482
Oh God, it's about time you got back,
it's been all go.

57
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,307
You had a job?

58
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,207
Girl on fifth...

59
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,107
Did you and her... hit it off?

60
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,125
Define "hit it off"?

61
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,782
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

62
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:37,907
No...

63
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,557
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

64
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:44,257
– No?!
– Yep!

65
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,079
Unbelievable!

66
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,957
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us
up there, no respect whatsoever!

67
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,482
We're all just drudgens to them.

68
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:52,457
Yes!

69
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,482
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

70
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,957
that is what we'd be to them.

71
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,332
It's like they're pally-wally

72
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,782
when there's a problem
with their printer

73
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,107
but once it's fixed...

74
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:02,432
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

75
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:03,007
Yes!

76
00:05:03,357 --> 00:05:06,407
Yesterday's jam!
That is what we are to them!

77
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,482
Actually you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing...

78
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,432
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

79
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,382
Hello, I.T. ?

80
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,332
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

81
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:25,507
Unisex toilets? You have unisex toilets,
like Ally McBeal?

82
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,107
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

83
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:37,482
A lot of sexy people not doing
much work... and having affairs.

84
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,632
Oh my God! Look at that view!

85
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,107
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

86
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:51,182
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.

87
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:52,432
Floor 34.

88
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,982
Great sir, thank you.
OK. Where am I going?

89
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,104
All... the way down to the basement.

90
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:01,332
Good luck!

91
00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:13,157
Get out of the lift...

92
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:42,232
– Oh. Won't be a tick!
– Oh my God!

93
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:45,707
Oh my God! Oh God! OK.

94
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,232
Hello?

95
00:06:58,857 --> 00:06:59,707
Hello?

96
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:44,057
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

97
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:49,191
I'm sorry, myself and Morris
were just engaged

98
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:51,357
in quite a serious discussion
about books and such.

99
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,207
We didn't hear you come in.

100
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:56,382
Wait a second, you said it was
Tolstoy, he said what?

101
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:58,382
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

102
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,082
When have you read Tolstoy?

103
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,707
Shut up, Morris!

104
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,643
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

105
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:07,007
When did... I don't remember
this conversation at all!

106
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,651
Don't... don't let me disturb you,
I just wanted to come down....

107
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,332
Don't be silly you never dist...

108
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,557
Many people come down here to visit!

109
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,357
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

110
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,682
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?!

111
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:37,482
So... What can we do you for?

112
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,882
I'm the new head of this department.

113
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,282
Is this my office?

114
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:48,907
Why? What did she... Did she just say...

115
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,455
– I am the head of this department!
–  I thought I was.

116
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:56,332
It's one of us! Certainly not her!
I'm gonna sort this out...

117
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,757
Roy! You've got a head wound there...
Head wound!

118
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:01,232
Hi!

119
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,382
I don't wanna be rude or anything

120
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:06,632
but I wasn't informed of any changes
to this department.

121
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:08,807
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

122
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:09,682
No!

123
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,257
And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much,

124
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,557
we're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

125
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:16,507
Sure... sure...

126
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:17,982
You know you're covered in blood?

127
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:20,757
Moss!

128
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:22,857
Amazon thingy.

129
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,467
Wicked!

130
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,882
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

131
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:30,066
I got the child edition
and the adult edition

132
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,782
just to check that there are
no differences in the text.

133
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:38,107
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able
to deal with that woman!

134
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,487
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!

135
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,057
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.

136
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,232
Come in!

137
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:55,322
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

138
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,607
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

139
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:01,507
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

140
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:03,682
Yeah, I know.

141
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:06,932
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

142
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:09,648
Ok!

143
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,960
Ok, take care, take care!

144
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,232
Ok bye! Bye!

145
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,507
Oh, so, hello!

146
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,732
What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

147
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,432
Hello. I was just wondering...

148
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,682
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

149
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,882
No no no... No.

150
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:39,207
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.

151
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:41,547
But how?!

152
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:45,182
Oh do you mind... Do you mind
closing the door for me?

153
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:46,857
– Oh yeah, sure.
– Yeah, Ok.

154
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,757
Yeah. From the other side...

155
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:53,607
Of course.

156
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:58,832
– Like this?\
– That's it!

157
00:10:59,932 --> 00:11:01,507
– With me on the...
– Thanks!

158
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,007
Are you all right?

159
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,282
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

160
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:19,787
The nurse said I didn't do myself
any serious damage.

161
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,034
I'm standing over here!

162
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,207
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

163
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,232
What we gonna do about her?

164
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:28,686
Well, I just went in, and she was having
a pretend conversation.

165
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:29,982
– Really?
– Yes.

166
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,907
She's a little bit weird...
to say the least.

167
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:35,757
What's that?

168
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,082
Oh just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

169
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,407
and this helps cool it down.

170
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:42,732
She is quite the oddbod...

171
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,157
Did you notice how
she didn't even get excited

172
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,382
when she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

173
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,182
Yeah, that was weird.

174
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,707
It's almost as if she doesn't know
anything about computers.

175
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:52,532
What?!

176
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,357
Look what you did!

177
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,932
Oh don't worry that's why
I always make 2 cups of tea.

178
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,727
Anyway, what were we talking about?

179
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:02,507
Oh, her not knowing anything
about computers.

180
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:03,182
What?!

181
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,197
I definitely want to get rid of her.

182
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,627
I agree yeah.

183
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,847
Ok, so, here's the plan:

184
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:21,582
A plan? Let me put on
my slightly larger glasses.

185
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:28,357
Ok, hit me!

186
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,857
– Ok. We go in...
– When?

187
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:33,532
You know, like in a minute.

188
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:36,007
Will that be enough time for me
to get to know the plan?

189
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:39,637
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!

190
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,827
I... I've clearly gotten you
over-excited!

191
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,737
Would "steamed" be a better word?

192
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,382
Although that's just as exciting,
I might even use these.

193
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,777
All I was gonna say was...

194
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:57,297
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks
about computers

195
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:58,482
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

196
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,647
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

197
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:06,967
Let me do the talk.

198
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:07,647
All right.

199
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:10,597
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

200
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,337
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

201
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:15,597
We... we need to stay calm.

202
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:18,137
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

203
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:31,757
Hang on, guys.

204
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:34,627
How can I help?

205
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,467
Well, we were just wondering
now that you're "The Boss",

206
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,747
would you like us to access
the data supplier

207
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,137
and connect you up to the matrix?

208
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:46,667
You just made all that up?

209
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:50,187
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

210
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:54,247
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there,

211
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:57,067
and do some work, to do with computers!

212
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:00,007
I'll be in there in a minute
and check up on you!

213
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,307
Ok, lady!

214
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,957
You've won this round, but we can wait!

215
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,197
You will slip up one day,

216
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,717
and believe you me,
we will be there when you do!

217
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,767
There will be some piece of evidence
that will prove

218
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:13,907
without any shadow of a doubt

219
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,767
that you don't know
anything about computers.

220
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:16,937
What are you doing?

221
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:19,157
Plugging in your computer.

222
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,287
It might be something you say...

223
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,897
or something you do!

224
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:28,917
But when we notice this,
and believe me we will notice this,

225
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:31,517
there's gonna be a long way down
for you, sweet chicks!

226
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:38,417
He'll realize in a second...

227
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,457
I cannot believe you're going
to tell on me.

228
00:14:50,837 --> 00:14:53,982
You're like a pair of horrible
old women.

229
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:55,827
What did she say?

230
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,447
She said we're like horrible old women.

231
00:14:58,537 --> 00:14:59,727
She didn't!

232
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,607
Hey guys!

233
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,087
Ok, got something to tell me?

234
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:04,787
Yes, well, it's like this:

235
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,247
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

236
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,627
– Yeah.
– Team players each and every one of you.

237
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:10,637
Yeah, what she...

238
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,657
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team!

239
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,717
Excuse me.

240
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:15,657
Hello?

241
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,057
What?!

242
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,707
Well if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired!

243
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,887
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!

244
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:25,617
Hello, Security?

245
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:27,727
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

246
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,477
Escort them from the premises.

247
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,597
And do it as a team!

248
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,282
Remember you're a team, and if you can't
act as a team, you're fired too!

249
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:35,777
Dawn!

250
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,607
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team

251
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:39,307
that can work as team.

252
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,357
They may have to escort our
security team from the building,

253
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,257
for not acting like a team!

254
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:49,837
Team! Team team team team team!

255
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,897
I even love saying the word "team".

256
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:54,532
You probably think that's a picture
of my family?

257
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:58,037
It's the A-Team.

258
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,797
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

259
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,357
All of them!

260
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:06,682
So what do you wanna tell me?

261
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,817
Well, it's just not working out.

262
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,667
– He's joking!
– But you said...

263
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:13,777
Not working out?

264
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,507
Oh no! No!

265
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:17,937
We are getting on like
a big house on fire!

266
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,787
– Yeah!
– My ear's getting hot!

267
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,607
No... You know what?
We should leave, now, because

268
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,067
you know, you're a busy man

269
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:28,097
and we've taken far too much
of your time.

270
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,907
Jen could you just get the door
for me there?

271
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:30,967
Absolutely Roy!

272
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,727
So why did you come here
in the first place?

273
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:39,227
We set up a voice activation system
on your computer.

274
00:16:39,307 --> 00:16:40,807
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

275
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:43,557
It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice

276
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:45,707
but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!

277
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:46,807
– Bye bye!
– Thank you!

278
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,257
How exciting!

279
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:52,767
Hello...

280
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:57,347
Hello computer!

281
00:17:01,557 --> 00:17:02,232
Hello!

282
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:07,047
Hello... Hello computer...

283
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:11,737
What good are you?

284
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:14,357
You obviously don't know anything
about computers.

285
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:15,757
No but... OK.

286
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:17,147
But I can learn.

287
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:20,107
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

288
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,082
you could take me through
what you're doing right now.

289
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,677
I'd be delighted!

290
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:26,847
I'm just working on a very simple piece
of programming code.

291
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,447
I see...

292
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:40,387
Oh God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!

293
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,687
I don't know anything
about computers, I mean...

294
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:46,432
I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.

295
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:52,057
Hi! Is... Roy around?

296
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:54,827
Hello there little lady!

297
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,387
Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.

298
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,207
You wanted me to come down?!

299
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:04,377
Well here I am!!

300
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,777
Not the face!!

301
00:18:06,507 --> 00:18:07,827
Not the face!!

302
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,347
Well maybe this will teach you

303
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,907
to treat people with
a little bit of respect!

304
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:17,097
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone
earlier?

305
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,787
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

306
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:21,447
Yes!

307
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:24,247
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

308
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,497
No! Got them in a sale.

309
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:27,817
Oh God! Clever you!

310
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:29,747
I'm never lucky enough
to get a bargain myself.

311
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:31,317
Well, I should take you shopping.

312
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,277
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

313
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,747
Oh I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you! Take care!

314
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:39,337
– Nice meeting you!
– Chairman! Wow!

315
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:41,877
You just diffuse that entire situation!

316
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:42,907
What situation?

317
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:47,477
Oh, that.. yeah!
Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

318
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:50,627
They're fairly regular,
the beatings, yes.

319
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:53,107
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

320
00:18:53,177 --> 00:18:54,837
Ah it's not all that bad!

321
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,567
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

322
00:18:58,047 --> 00:19:00,887
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean...

323
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:03,227
I'm a people person and...

324
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:05,917
people like you need a person
to deal with people...

325
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:08,597
a people person like me. Oh my God!

326
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,487
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!

327
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,547
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

328
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:15,867
if I told you that I had a plan

329
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:19,927
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?

330
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,927
I can't be done! You're crazy!

331
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:25,697
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out! Ok!

332
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,177
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

333
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,517
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY

334
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:04,577
No no! Oh no, really really really,
that was a true story!

335
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,017
Unbelievable!

336
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:09,097
I said why we don't go out
with the I.T. guys more often?

337
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:11,427
– You're hilarious!
– Yes we are!

338
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,877
You guys should come down here
more often you know,

339
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,577
you should see this as a new era
for Reynholm Industries.

340
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,467
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

341
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:24,947
Do you know what! If you want
to hear something really funny,

342
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,107
a really funny story,

343
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,807
you should hear what happened
to Moss and I,

344
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,497
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

345
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,437
that Moss lost his glasses!

346
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,667
Moss! Moss!

347
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,267
Come here! Come here!

348
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:38,177
Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

349
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:38,857
Really?

350
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,457
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

351
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:42,297
Oh this a great story,
you're gonna love it!

352
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,147
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

353
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:47,517
Well go on, then.

354
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,417
All right.

355
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:55,567
– Well, one night, we were really drunk.
– Yeah.

356
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:59,807
And huh, we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

357
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,757
And when they arrived to the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

358
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,537
so we brought them to the fair.

359
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:11,317
Oh really nice! In the end,
they only charged us half.

360
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,447
But we did have to pay
for all the rides.

361
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:22,737
Oh isn't that just the best story?

362
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,377
Oh, man!

363
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,837
You told me to never tell that story
to anyone.

364
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:29,117
Well, what're you talking about?
That's a brilliant story!

365
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,767
And then you nearly walked
into the canal!

366
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,627
Has it got to that part
with the boatman?

367
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:39,427
Do you mean the story
when I lost my glasses?

368
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:44,457
Yes!

369
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:51,177
What story did you think I mean?

370
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:52,657
Moss?

371
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:57,332
What did you say?! What did you say?!

372
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,717
It's all right for you two.

373
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:04,807
You're used to being social social piranhas...

374
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:11,547
I'm a very popular person usually.

375
00:22:11,577 --> 00:22:15,957
That girl earlier, that tried
to beat me to death with her shoes,

376
00:22:16,717 --> 00:22:18,547
did anybody get her number?

377
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,997
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

378
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,807
With Brandy and Crystal!

379
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:31,457
Hello I.T.?

380
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:35,827
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

381
00:23:07,237 --> 00:23:10,077
Hello! Hello!
