1
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:33,413
The Red Door.

2
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:39,687
"We don't need no education!"

3
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:40,747
Yes you do.

4
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:42,527
You've just used the double negative.

5
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,287
Notice anything?

6
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,097
– What?
– Yes.

7
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,467
Your eyes, something's wrong
with your eyes.

8
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,067
No... I have a new cup.

9
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,417
What's wrong with my eyes?

10
00:00:58,477 --> 00:01:00,197
It's not very distinctive, is it?

11
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:01,897
How's anyone supposed to know
it's yours?

12
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,527
There's a picture of me on it.

13
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:05,807
No, there isn't!

14
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:08,017
– Yes there is.
– No there isn't!

15
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:09,477
– Moss!
– Yes there is.

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,997
I'm sick of my things going walk about.

17
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,307
With this picture,

18
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:17,087
everyone knows that a certain Mr. Moss
might be looking for his cup...

19
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,777
There is nothing on the cup!

20
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:21,757
Wrangle with him and you'll find
your handful my friend.

21
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:22,947
Wrangle! With who?

22
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,387
There's no one there!

23
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,077
– Morning.
– Morning.

24
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:28,537
Did you have a nice week-end?

25
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,787
– It was alright, thanks.
– Not you!

26
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:32,787
I did too.

27
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:34,567
Nice scarf.

28
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:37,337
– I'm not wearing a scarf.
– Not you, Moss!

29
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:39,897
Notice anything new about Moss?

30
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,257
His eyes?

31
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,857
What is wrong with my eyes?

32
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,537
No, he has a new cup.

33
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:47,267
It's the talk of the office.

34
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:49,337
Yes, I think I read about it in Hits.

35
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,387
Receptionist 3rd floor,
Gloria what's-her-name...

36
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:54,617
Have you seen her baby?

37
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,737
I didn't even know she was pregnant.

38
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:58,017
She was onto here!

39
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,877
Yeah, I thought she was stealing
office equipment.

40
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,517
That's how I got that monitor home.

41
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:14,547
– Do you want to seat here?
– Thank you.

42
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,207
– What?
– Ask me where it is...

43
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:23,567
– Where what is?
– The picture.

44
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,867
Where is the picture, Moss?

45
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,337
It's on the base, Roy.

46
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,057
OK, well, let's see it then!

47
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,597
Sure, I pour hot water all over myself,
and we all have a good chuckle.

48
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,377
Everyone except muggins here.

49
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:40,287
Show you in a minute.

50
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,397
Can I ask you two a question?

51
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:43,957
Please, Christ, yes!

52
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:45,907
Wait, wait. One moment, wait.

53
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:49,897
Ok. Go.

54
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:53,247
How can you two live like this?

55
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:56,627
– How can you two...
– Don't google the question Moss!

56
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,467
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,217
It's so disgusting in here.

58
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,037
I mean I know nobody comes down here,

59
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,617
but it doesn't mean you have to live
like animals, you know...

60
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:07,487
I mean for a start
you could clean that window

61
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:08,957
and you'd have a bit of light in here.

62
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:10,067
What window?

63
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,377
That one up there.

64
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,827
Yeah, that's not a window.

65
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:14,077
Yes it is.

66
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,677
Get it clean, you'll have
some light in here.

67
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,747
I think that we have plenty of light...

68
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:24,777
light to be doing fine!

69
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,227
I mean look at that CD tray.

70
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,097
Isn't that important,

71
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:33,427
when you'd like to actually put CDs
in there at some point?

72
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,287
Well, yes, ideally, but

73
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,057
I haven't the heart to move them.

74
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:42,847
I mean, how did that even happen?

75
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,117
Ok. Now, I'm curious.

76
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,607
Give us a look at the picture then.

77
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,737
What picture?

78
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,257
The picture on the cup.

79
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:53,507
Right!

80
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:57,807
Behold!

81
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,077
There's nothing there!

82
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:03,607
What?!

83
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,857
This isn't my cup!

84
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,267
What is that?

85
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:18,307
Goat's cheese salad?

86
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,657
You don't like goat's cheese?

87
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,397
I don't like goat's anything!

88
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,637
I don't like goats...

89
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:28,017
being involved in any stage
of the food production process.

90
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,257
Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?

91
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:37,857
What are you eating anyway?

92
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,427
It's a bucket of fried chicken.

93
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,747
You know, it comes in a real bucket now.

94
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,067
Tell me,

95
00:04:45,187 --> 00:04:47,347
what's behind that red door?

96
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:52,617
Nothing.

97
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,227
Well, there must be something behind it.

98
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,547
There's nothing behind the red door,
Jen.

99
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,077
– Well then I can just go...
– No Jen!

100
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,357
It's just a boring old store room,
that's all.

101
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:03,467
It's just a store room where we keep
the snibbits.

102
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,097
What's a snibbit?

103
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,477
It's a kind of planch.

104
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:09,657
A planch for the computers?

105
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,317
Yes. Computer planch.

106
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:13,347
Well, if it's a store room,

107
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,757
– you can store some of this stuff.
– No! Jen, Jen!

108
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:18,477
Look, I know that you wanna make
your mark down here and,

109
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:21,297
and that's really sweet, but,

110
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:24,977
you can't just go messing around
with the snibbits door room,

111
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:26,147
willy-nilly.

112
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:30,197
You... You can't upset the whole harmony
of the place.

113
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,597
Harmony! What harmony?

114
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:35,147
Look, I know that the place
looks like a bit of a mess,

115
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,637
but it's actually a very delicate
ecosystem.

116
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,277
Everything is connected.

117
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:48,237
It's like the rainforest.

118
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:51,877
You change one thing,

119
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,367
even the tiniest bit,

120
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,697
and the whole rainforest dies.

121
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,217
You don't want the rainforest to die, do you?

122
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:05,597
No, I really don't want
the rainforest to die.

123
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,487
That's what will happen
if you open the red door.

124
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:14,467
Hello, I.T., have you tried
turning it off and on again?

125
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,347
Ok, but are you sure
that it's plugged in?

126
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,377
Ok, well I'll be up in a minute.

127
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,767
What was that about?

128
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:26,057
Just a girl on four.

129
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,177
Oh, a job?

130
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:28,277
You gonna go?

131
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,137
Yeah. In a while.

132
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,307
It can wait.

133
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,257
But why can it wait?
She probably needs to get on,

134
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,607
she needs her computer, you know.

135
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,827
Yeah well, I am reading a comic.

136
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,247
I knew it.

137
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:40,617
Every time I used to phone I.T.
in my last job

138
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,337
it's a good couple of hours
before someone got to me.

139
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,867
That is how we do it.

140
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,627
You can't go up straight away

141
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,747
or they'll all expect it.

142
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:48,977
You're killing the rainforest!

143
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,427
Stop saying that!

144
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,247
Look there's more than that:
me and this girl,

145
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,057
I asked her out once,

146
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,347
she said no, it all got
a little bit embarrassing

147
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:56,847
and ever since then, whenever I go up,

148
00:06:56,887 --> 00:07:00,167
she treats me like I'm some sort of
sexually frustrated cretin.

149
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:04,557
Get up there now, please.

150
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,437
You're not the head of this department.

151
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:08,167
No, I'm relationship manager.

152
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,677
I'm the one you gets the complaints.

153
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,027
I'm the one who gets in trouble.

154
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,557
I'm the one whose name is on the line...

155
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,497
Oh God! All right,

156
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,157
I will go up just to shut you up.

157
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,187
Watch her!

158
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,407
For God's sake!

159
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,357
There's someone under here.

160
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,497
Yes!

161
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:57,557
Hello!

162
00:07:58,157 --> 00:07:59,247
Hello?

163
00:08:07,007 --> 00:08:08,357
Did you get it fixed?

164
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,237
Oh, yeah.

165
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:11,437
Well, left him to it.

166
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:13,037
– Just can't have him in sight.
– Yeah.

167
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,947
Do what you need and just go.

168
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,187
What are you laughing at?

169
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,337
This flipping circuit board, Jen,

170
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,637
Some chump has run the data line
right through the power supply.

171
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:40,727
Amateur hour!

172
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,317
I've got tears in my eyes.

173
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,117
Roy's stuck under a desk.

174
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,127
Stuck under a desk?!

175
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:56,907
Yes. It is an unusual text, isn't it?
It's not just me?

176
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:58,957
No, it's unusual.

177
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,407
I'd best investigate.

178
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:02,647
Yes.

179
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,207
You investigate.

180
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:06,097
I'll hold the fort.

181
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,557
Listen, I'm really sorry
about your hand.

182
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:55,677
Oh, don't worry about it.
I must have cut it when I swooned.

183
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,137
I startled you a bit.

184
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,597
I didn't know there were anyone else
down here.

185
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,357
I thought it was just the three of us.

186
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:04,637
I often work at nights so, perhaps
that's why you haven't seen me.

187
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:06,917
Gosh, it's very cold in here, isn't it?

188
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,777
Air conditioning.

189
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,437
Keep these things cool.

190
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:11,737
Yes, what are they?

191
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,047
I've no idea.

192
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,547
They have put me in charge of them.

193
00:10:16,587 --> 00:10:17,877
Moss and Roy.

194
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,907
I don't know their names.

195
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,427
I mean,

196
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:26,107
I don't know any of these stuff
even does.

197
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:27,947
What's going on there?

198
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,767
I don't know.

199
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:32,787
Is it good that it's doing that?

200
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:35,807
Usually, it doesn't do that.

201
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,067
And I think I should tell them, but,

202
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,847
but often I just look away.

203
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:42,817
And this one:

204
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,187
Flash.

205
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,427
Flash.

206
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,607
Flash.

207
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:47,707
Then wait for it.

208
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:48,887
Nothing for a while.

209
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,627
Here it comes.

210
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:53,247
Double flash.

211
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:55,607
Brilliant.

212
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,067
It's obvious you are going mad.

213
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,427
So, let me get this straight.

214
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,417
You stay down here all the time.

215
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:07,017
I pop out occasionally
when I have to get supplies.

216
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,787
And you don't know why you're here,

217
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,307
or what you do.

218
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:13,507
Correct.

219
00:11:13,587 --> 00:11:16,917
So this is your job?
This is what you want for a career?

220
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,287
No.

221
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,007
You don't understand.

222
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:22,607
I'm not here because...
I want to be here.

223
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:23,867
This is...

224
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,107
This is my punishment.

225
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:30,487
You see, I used to be Denholm's
second in command.

226
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,147
Do I amaze you?

227
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,847
So, how did you end up down here?

228
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,847
That's the question I've been
asking myself for 4 long years.

229
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,807
Oh I... couldn't help noticing
that you're bleeding.

230
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:47,607
– Yes. No it's fine it...
– Just let me...

231
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,267
– Please I can help.
– I'll deal

232
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,207
with myself at home
but the risk is, honestly....

233
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,247
Oh my...

234
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,237
Oh my God.

235
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,307
Please, excuse, excuse me,
what are you doi...

236
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,027
Get off me! Get...

237
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,307
Thank you.

238
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:05,667
That should clear up nicely.

239
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:10,347
Yes, there was a time
when things were very different.

240
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,777
I was one of Reynholm Industries'
top guys.

241
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:24,957
You should have seen me,
I was magical.

242
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,027
Here's me saying some pretty
important stuff

243
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:28,877
to a group of people circled
around me.

244
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:31,837
In a boardroom,
I was a wizard.

245
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,247
A punchy character.

246
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:34,547
Here's me with a graph.

247
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,047
Things were moving fast.

248
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:41,897
So fast, my career was advancing
by leaps and bounds.

249
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:44,687
Adam saw greater things for me.

250
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,977
They were crazy heady days.

251
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,267
It seemed like these days
would last forever.

252
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,277
But it all changed.

253
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,037
So, what happened?

254
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,067
It's quite a long story actually.

255
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:03,167
Really? Don't worry about it then.

256
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:37,637
Oh my good gracious me, look at that!

257
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:41,217
Quick!

258
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:42,507
What is it?

259
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:44,077
I can't explain it.

260
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,227
You're just going to have to come
over here,

261
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,667
and look out this window for a while.

262
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,057
Whatever it is, we're not interested.

263
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:55,507
Well. I have to say you're missing out.

264
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:56,887
Fine.

265
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,257
Jiminy!

266
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:01,397
Jones!

267
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:03,107
Look, the nature of the things

268
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,497
that is happening has changed...
slightly,

269
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:08,127
rendering it yet more interesting.

270
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,377
Someday, I will tell my kids about this.

271
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,187
But you can't even tell us...

272
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,217
How are you gonna tell your children?

273
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:18,967
Oh, you have no...
interest in the world.

274
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,277
Are you sure it's okay to come out?

275
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:31,317
Yeah, don't you worry about those two.

276
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,607
And listen Richmond,
I've always wanted to know yeah,

277
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,227
why do you never see
any Cockney Goths?

278
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:37,887
That's you cheerful.

279
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:40,737
It's spoiled for the rest of us.

280
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,587
And how come you never see
Goths driving cars?

281
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,157
We drive cars...

282
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:46,587
We're just like you really...

283
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:48,497
except that we listen to
Cradle of Filth.

284
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:51,797
Cradle of Filth,
I presume that's a band.

285
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:55,147
It's not literally a cradle of filth?

286
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,547
Oh no. That would be horrible.

287
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,087
Cradle of Filth are actually

288
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:03,007
one the best contemporary
dark-wave bands in the world.

289
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,597
I'll never forget the first time
I heard them.

290
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:12,727
Changed my life.

291
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,947
Blew my mind.

292
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:18,027
I was lucky I discovered them
when I did!

293
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,887
Because it was around that time that

294
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,357
things started to go wrong
for me at work.

295
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,097
I don't know what happened.

296
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,997
Suddenly, people just weren't
returning my calls.

297
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,487
In my strategy meetings,

298
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,077
they'd seemed distracted.

299
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:32,667
Distant.

300
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,137
I couldn't put my finger on it

301
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:35,927
but something was wrong.

302
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:37,877
I'll tell you.

303
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,107
It was good to have
the Filth to come home to

304
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,637
after another disappointing day.

305
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,707
You've got to help Roy!

306
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,577
Richmond's out of his room.

307
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,207
He's not in his room,
he's supposed to be in his room.

308
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,947
Why is he out of his room?

309
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:54,277
Well, he's gotta come out
and play with us for a while.

310
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,867
But the rainforest and...

311
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,357
What's wrong with you Moss?

312
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:00,947
Roy's stuck underneath a lady's desk.

313
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,417
What! Still?!

314
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:04,477
Look, I know that normally
this would be very funny

315
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,847
but he's been under there too long
for reasonable explanation.

316
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:09,397
That woman looks down, she's going
to assume he's a desk rabbit.

317
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:11,457
– What's a desk rabbit?
– I just made that up.

318
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,117
But that's probably going to be

319
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,737
what they'll sort of call
people like Roy.

320
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,697
But Roy is not a desk rabbit,
he's my best friend.

321
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:20,417
Unless you do something so tumble you,
me and Tim Burton over there.

322
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:23,247
What can I possibly do? I...

323
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:24,997
Look, she could look under there
any minute.

324
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:27,287
– It could already be too late.
– I don't know what to do...

325
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,557
You're relationship manager,
that falls under relationship.

326
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:30,897
Alright, alright.

327
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,157
Just shut you up.

328
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,117
Hello Richmond.

329
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,617
How are things?

330
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:40,847
Oh you know.

331
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,127
Not brilliant.

332
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,957
He's supposed to be in his room.

333
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:05,227
There's a builder outside,
taking off his shirt.

334
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,837
– Like in ads?
– Yeah, like in ads...

335
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,807
– Easy one downstairs?
– They're fine, yeah.

336
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:25,077
I left Moss and Richmond in charge.

337
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,277
Good, well Moss...

338
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:28,257
Richmond!
He's not out of his room, is he?

339
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,127
Yeah.

340
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:31,697
What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!

341
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,317
It was the only thing that I asked you!

342
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,567
What have you got against him?

343
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:35,537
Just don't like him.

344
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,667
Oh God, you're just like
the rest of them,

345
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:40,667
the people that turn their backs on him
as soon as he became a Goth.

346
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:42,907
He obviously hasn't told you
about the funeral.

347
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,477
I think that you should ask him
about the funeral.

348
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:54,587
Hello Denholm.

349
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:57,367
Hi Jen.
I'm just enjoying this cup of tea.

350
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,347
Brilliant!

351
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,757
How you doing Jen?

352
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,997
Yeah. Just to say...

353
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,007
I met Richmond.

354
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,077
I see.

355
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,387
It's not for me to say Denholm, but

356
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:16,097
it sounds like you two
had a good relationship at one point.

357
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,817
You should speak to him.

358
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,727
I'll thank you to keep out of this Jen.

359
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:23,487
– Goths are people too.
– Enough!

360
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,497
There's absolutely no point to anything.

361
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:38,197
You're right, no point, it's all futile,
can't even find my cup.

362
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,817
Try to look on the bright side.

363
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:44,237
Ah! The bright side!

364
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,107
Sometimes, you just think

365
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:49,177
what would actually change
if I just killed myself.

366
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,217
You're right.

367
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,447
I could just kill myself.

368
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,737
And it'd be so easy, wouldn't it?

369
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:58,237
So very, very easy.

370
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,467
Richmond!

371
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,487
Get back to your room!

372
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,387
What's the point of sending him
back to him room,

373
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,527
what's the point of anything?

374
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:08,317
Come on, get brush! Come on!

375
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:09,787
But she said I could come out.

376
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:12,057
Well you can't come out.
You're bringing everyone down.

377
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,757
– No, I'm not.
– Yes, he is!

378
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,577
– Come on!
– Thank you.

379
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:17,237
Okay well then, tell her,

380
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:19,527
why they sent you down here.
Tell her what you did.

381
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:22,037
I didn't do anything,
I don't know why I'm down here.

382
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,187
So Denholm just amorted you
for nothing, did he?

383
00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:25,897
No, he changed.

384
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,967
After his father died.
I don't think he ever fully recovered.

385
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,497
From the moment I saw him
at the funeral,

386
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:33,727
I could tell there was something
different.

387
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:46,437
Bloody good of you to come, thanks.

388
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,577
Thanks.

389
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,507
Bloody good service, wasn't it? Yeah?

390
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,557
– Thank you.
– Watch your bloody hand!

391
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:56,717
I'm so sorry.

392
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:58,617
Here.

393
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,087
It's Cradle of Filth.

394
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:03,567
It got me through
some pretty bleak times.

395
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,097
Try track 4, Coffin Fodder.

396
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,207
It sounds horrible,
but it's actually quite beautiful.

397
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,667
Relationship manager.

398
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,267
Yes. Yes of course.

399
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,327
First thing tomorrow.

400
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:33,897
That was Denholm.

401
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,177
He wants to see you.

402
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,037
What is it?!

403
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,407
I can't believe you want me back.

404
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,947
You've got Jen to thank for that.

405
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,327
Her words the other day,
moved me deeply.

406
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,727
Very deeply indeed.

407
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,587
Really? What did she say?

408
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:06,877
Like I remember!

409
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,587
Point is: it's the effect of her words
that's important.

410
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,067
I now know that treating someone
differently

411
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,587
just because of the colour
of their skin is wrong.

412
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:17,337
I don't see why things can't get back
to the way they were.

413
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,217
I just don't know what to say.

414
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:21,797
You're back with the big guys Richmond!

415
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:22,437
Great!

416
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,257
That's if you're prepared
to take me on again.

417
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:25,927
You know how demanding I am.

418
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:28,097
Stop it.

419
00:21:28,127 --> 00:21:29,557
You know how changeable I can be.

420
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,287
Yes Mr. Denholm.

421
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:32,577
Call me Denholm!

422
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,087
All right, thanks Denholm.

423
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,807
No no. I don't like that.
Don't do it again.

424
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,217
All right, sorry.

425
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,287
In fact, I've changed my mind
about the whole thing.

426
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:42,067
What? You mean I have to stay down here?

427
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:42,877
Yes!

428
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,517
And leave me alone you goblin!

429
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,507
Oh well. I suppose it's not quite so bad

430
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,627
now that I don't have
to stay in that room.

431
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:52,997
Yes, yes.

432
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,027
Well, we're happy to have you.

433
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,487
My milky lens has popped out.

434
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,787
Don't step on it.

435
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,657
You've got... to help me find it.

436
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:07,697
Oh, actually,
I think it's just popped round the back.

437
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:09,577
It does that sometimes.

438
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,217
Come on.

439
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,537
Come on. Come on fellow.

440
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:16,377
Come on.

441
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:18,457
There.

442
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:22,717
How about that then?

443
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:25,407
That looks great!

444
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,347
Told you it was a window.

445
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:32,417
Bloody lens.

446
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:39,857
I'd... really ought to...

447
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:41,987
Actually, I'm gonna...

448
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,847
Thank God.

449
00:22:49,557 --> 00:22:51,797
At least, everything is back to normal.

450
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,877
As long as no one goes through
that door.
