1
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,187
Here we are!

2
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,417
Your place... your place...

3
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,357
La maison... de la femme...

4
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,487
El casa del signorita...

5
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:54,367
Das haus die Frau...

6
00:00:57,717 --> 00:00:58,717
Good night!

7
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,767
I'll just walk you to the door.

8
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:03,827
– There's no need.
– That's okay.

9
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:10,847
So...

10
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:13,687
I guess this is "arrivederci".

11
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:17,457
I'd quite fancy a cup of tea though.

12
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,087
A glass of water maybe.

13
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:24,667
Perhaps a little lie down.

14
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:25,737
Look...

15
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:27,907
I have to tell you something.

16
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,907
What?

17
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:31,237
I wanted to tell you
in the restaurant but...

18
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,737
it... a good time
never came up and I...

19
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:36,147
– I wasn't gonna say it but...
– Say it.

20
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:37,987
I have to.

21
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,247
What?

22
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:44,217
You've got shit on your head.

23
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,107
What?

24
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,037
There's some shit on your head.

25
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:53,117
What?

26
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:54,907
Where? Where?

27
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:56,957
It's been there forever.

28
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:59,277
Oh God! Oh God!

29
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,137
It's chocolate!

30
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,197
It's chocolate!

31
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,207
It's not shit!

32
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:06,097
It's not shit!

33
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,097
It's..

34
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:08,597
It's my dessert.

35
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,517
I don't know
how it got there but uh...

36
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:12,567
It's on my fingers.

37
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,267
It's not shit!

38
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,477
Thank God for that!

39
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:21,277
You know, I just spent the last hour

40
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:24,397
thinking you were some sort
of disgusting tramp.

41
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,777
Oh no!

42
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:28,527
That's funny!

43
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,627
– Oh God look!
– What?

44
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:35,137
It's chocolate!

45
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:39,707
How about that cup of tea now?

46
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,997
I was a perfect gentleman last night
from beginning to end

47
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,087
but she can't see past
a little bit of shit on my forehead!

48
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:50,607
I thought you said it was chocolate.

49
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,687
Yes, chocolate, yes!
I meant chocolate.

50
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:55,747
I forgot to turn this thing on.

51
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:57,967
Hello, IT.

52
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,247
Hi, something's wrong
with my computer.

53
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,717
Have you tried
turning it off and on again?

54
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,327
Oh No! No, oh Dear, thanks.

55
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:06,977
You're welcome then.

56
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,237
It's typical.

57
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:12,227
The one time I manage
to bamboozle a girl in the building

58
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:14,457
into going out with me
and this happens.

59
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:16,427
She's gonna tell everyone!

60
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:18,697
Oh come on! She's a receptionist,

61
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,267
she'd hardly gossip.

62
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,257
Besides it's a boring story.

63
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,337
Yeah... that's boring.

64
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,597
It's boring, she won't tell anyone.

65
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,447
Hello.

66
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:48,717
Sorry guys.

67
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,487
She might have told Jen.

68
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,547
No, that's what I'm saying.

69
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:02,797
It wasn't. It was...

70
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,077
It was chocolate. It was chocolate.

71
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:07,637
I don't know...
I don't know... it...

72
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,647
it got on my fingers
and then I must have...

73
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,807
Listen...

74
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,717
how did you even hear
about this, mom?

75
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,947
Moss... Moss,
there's a spider in my office.

76
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,457
Could you deal with it?
I just hate spiders.

77
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:27,427
I'm not overly fond of them
myself there, Jen.

78
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:29,377
How...

79
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:34,917
How big is... Whoa! Hey now!

80
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,447
I'll tell you what.

81
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,457
I actually recommend
my good friend Roy there

82
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,727
as the go-to guy on anything

83
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:43,837
with more than 7 eyes.

84
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,077
He's on a very brief
personal call right now.

85
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:48,247
Come, Moss. Don't be silly.

86
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,437
You're right, I'm being silly.
Wrap it up, Roy!

87
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,997
It's just a spider. It's fine.

88
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:57,157
Oh look! It seems to have left
of its own volition.

89
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,547
Oh, be a man, Moss!

90
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,077
You're right, I'll be a man.
I'm a man.

91
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,167
Please don't shut the door.

92
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:06,677
I won't.

93
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,127
Goodbye, Jen.

94
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:14,167
That was my mother.

95
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:15,997
How did she hear about this?

96
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,377
Oh, was that the woman
who phoned earlier?

97
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:20,497
'Cause I've just been
telling everybody.

98
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,397
Why would you want to go out
with Patricia anyway?

99
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,417
I mean, her last boyfriend
was Simon from 3rd.

100
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,337
– Jen!
– Hey, you!

101
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:29,867
Hello there.

102
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,687
Have you caught it yet?

103
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,327
Not quite, Jen.

104
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,137
The spider's managed
to walk behind me.

105
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:38,707
And it's between me and the door.

106
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:41,757
So I can't get out.

107
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:45,457
Simon from 3rd
is the one with the hair.

108
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,007
Oh, him! Oh, he's awful.

109
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:51,267
He once ate
a copy of Loaded for a bet.

110
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,137
– She liked him?
– Apparently.

111
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,937
That explains everything!

112
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:00,177
She likes the kind of big obnoxious guy
who eats Loaders.

113
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:04,257
Hello, Daniel.

114
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:05,717
How are you?

115
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,167
I'm great, thanks. How are you?

116
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,167
I'm great.

117
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,087
Well, can either of you tell me...
Okay... Okay...

118
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:15,887
who wrote Missa Brevis in D minor?
Was it Mozart or Beethoven?

119
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:20,127
That was a certain Mr. Mozart,
I think you'll find.

120
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,837
Oh right, do you know a lot
about classical music?

121
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,197
– Petit pois.
– Oh, right.

122
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,997
Mozart, Beethoven, 50/50 ain't it?

123
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:33,427
Actually, no, you were right.
It was Mozart.

124
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,547
Well it's... It was...

125
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,637
Okay, so, let's try another one.

126
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:40,527
Okay. Here we go.
In what year did Mozart die?

127
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:43,457
– Was it 1780 or 1791?
– 1791.

128
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:47,937
Yes! Yes! Bang on! Good!

129
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,047
God!
I hope he doesn't come in again!

130
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,357
– Jen!
– Yes!

131
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,287
Is Roy off the phone yet?
The spider is now upon my person.

132
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,757
You guys don't mind me
chilling out in here, do you?

133
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,587
No. Chill out!

134
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,087
So did you see the match last night?

135
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:17,247
– Oh yeah!
– Oh yeah!

136
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:18,417
– God!
– Did we?

137
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,287
What a match!

138
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,497
All of the players running up...

139
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,727
the pitch...

140
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:29,027
and running down it again.
Such athleticism!

141
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:31,547
What was Rooney thinking over there?

142
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,177
Who knows! That's Rooney!

143
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,347
He is a foolish boy!

144
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:43,457
Yeah but... that referee...
I'm sorry the referee is just an idiot.

145
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:47,027
Yes, he was certainly
the villain of the piece.

146
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:50,087
Daniel, you're still here.

147
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,517
Yeah, just...
just having a little break.

148
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:54,177
Do you wanna come and join me?

149
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:56,357
Stop it!

150
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:01,127
Well, I'd better...
I'd better... hit this way.

151
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,027
Oh by the way, guys, if you need
any help with any more spiders,

152
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,737
just give me a call, okay?

153
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,947
Yeah, we'll be fine, I think, thanks.

154
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:09,717
Actually, do you have a card?

155
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,797
That is good. See you.

156
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,577
You like him!

157
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:20,637
Who?

158
00:08:21,287 --> 00:08:24,017
Oh, that good looking man
with "Security"

159
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,297
written on his shoulders? Yes!

160
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,487
Yes, I do.

161
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:28,307
He seems really nice.

162
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:29,927
Nice!

163
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:33,067
'Cause that's what you women want!
Nice guys!

164
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:34,697
Hello, IT!

165
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,477
What are you talking about, Roy?

166
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:39,807
If my date last night proved anything,
it's that you, ladies,

167
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,457
you don't want nice guys.

168
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,267
I think if your date proved anything,
Roy,

169
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:46,437
it's that women like men
without poo on their foreheads.

170
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:48,187
That's our type.

171
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,967
That has nothing to do with this.

172
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,907
She clearly just didn't want
a gentleman in her life.

173
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:56,127
I hate to generalize, you know that.

174
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:58,847
But all women just want bastards.

175
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:03,817
That women liking bastards thing
is a total myth.

176
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,477
I've tried turning it off and on again
and nothing happened.

177
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,097
Is it definitely plugged in?

178
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:11,357
Oh, let me have a look.

179
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:13,657
Oh, sorry, that's it, thanks very much.

180
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:14,717
You're welcome then.

181
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:16,987
It's just not true.

182
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,847
Women don't want gentlemen,
they want bullies and thugs.

183
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,217
I'll prove it to you.

184
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:24,047
How will you prove it to me, Roy?

185
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,117
Oh! Okay.

186
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:30,017
I'll put a...
I'll put on a classified ad online.

187
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,177
A classified?

188
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:32,777
Yeah, like a lonely hearts thing

189
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,277
but I'll make it sound psychotic.

190
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,587
And I still bet
I'll get a bezillion replies.

191
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:37,527
Oh, dear God.

192
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:38,527
Come on. How much?

193
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:43,717
Okay. Yeah, I'll give you
20 quid if you get 1 response.

194
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:44,647
You're on!

195
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:45,767
Oh my God, no!

196
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,847
It's all about body fluids
with you, isn't it?

197
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,287
Come on, Moss! We need to get to work.

198
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:55,237
Work?

199
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:58,457
Yeah, we need to post
a classified lonely hearts ad online

200
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,957
that makes me sound like a psycho
so that I can prove to Jen

201
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:04,057
that all women love bastards
and therefore win 20 pounds.

202
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:07,037
Thank God!
I thought that thing was broken.

203
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:18,007
"Shut up! Do what I tell you!
I'm not interested!"

204
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:23,667
These are just some of the things
you'll be hearing if you answer this ad.

205
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:27,777
"I'm an idiot and
I don't care about anyone but myself."

206
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,457
"PS: No dogs."

207
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:34,247
– That's good.
– What's yours?

208
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:36,517
Mine doesn't look any good now.

209
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,637
Go on.

210
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:40,177
"I'm going to murder you."

211
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,527
"You bloody woman!"

212
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,617
Might want to play a bit hard to get.

213
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,687
If you were a murderer,
what would your nickname be?

214
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:54,997
Mine would be "The Gardener",

215
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,207
'cause I'd always leave a rose
at the scene of the crime.

216
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,717
What would your murder weapon be?

217
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:02,687
A hammer.

218
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:05,987
Hey, Moss.

219
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,257
"Would you like to go
for dinner with me?"

220
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:15,297
"And then maybe back to my place?"

221
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,667
I'd love to, Jen, but I'm actually
helping Roy at the moment.

222
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,997
No. No, no, no.
Who does this remind you of, yeah?

223
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,657
"Do you wanna go on a date with me?"

224
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:29,237
Gandhi?

225
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,377
No, no, the other one. Bono.

226
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,577
No, no, I was doing Roy.

227
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:38,947
Yes, yes, it's like there was 2 of me.

228
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,077
Come on.
Get your money ready. 20 pounds.

229
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:44,887
Hey! Hello.

230
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,347
It's security.

231
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:51,977
I hope I'm not in any danger.

232
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:53,177
Oh my God!

233
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:54,577
It's not shit!

234
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,777
On my head, it's not shit!

235
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,557
It's chocolate spread.

236
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,997
– Taste it!
– No!

237
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:02,977
Look!

238
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:04,087
Look!

239
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,007
Ringo Starr?

240
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,877
I'll be wondering about that all night!

241
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:14,457
How do you know about this site?

242
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,457
I'm a member.

243
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:20,067
Really?
You do the whole lonely hearts thing?

244
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,997
I'm a 32-year-old IT man
who works in a basement.

245
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,007
Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.

246
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:33,357
So, as you can clearly see, it wasn't...

247
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:37,027
excrement, it was chocolate.

248
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,267
I was playing a joke. It was chocolate.

249
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,767
Jen, it's okay, I've got it.
Don't worry about it.

250
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,957
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

251
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,787
– I've got a response!
– That was quick!

252
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,337
Yeah,
why is it taking so long to download?

253
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,367
Something happened
with the router this morning.

254
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,217
We're back to pre-broadband speed.

255
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:56,277
Dear...

256
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:04,737
But we're on the phone now.

257
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,397
Why can't you just ask me now?

258
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,067
Can't Jen, trust me.

259
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,847
Why should I trust you?

260
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:11,797
Because I know what's good for you.

261
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:17,437
Listen, you have to be home between
8 and 9 tonight, are you gonna be home?

262
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,397
Okay, this sounds exciting.

263
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:22,157
It might not happen, okay?
But hopefully it will.

264
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,147
Now I don't know
if this is exciting or not...

265
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,347
Jen... Jen, it's exciting!

266
00:13:30,457 --> 00:13:33,457
"...would be very interested in
meeting up and talking it over."

267
00:13:33,457 --> 00:13:34,457
"Love, Rebecca."

268
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,547
Oh my God! What did we write again?

269
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,107
It started with "shut up".

270
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:40,867
There's more.

271
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,817
"I attached a photograph
for your approval...

272
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,597
"or not!" Exclamation mark.

273
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:48,587
All right, let's have a look at you,
you mad thing.

274
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,617
Nice hair so far.

275
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,717
– Eyebrows seem normal.
– Two eyes.

276
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,227
That's the best amount of eyes.

277
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:02,637
Nice eyes too.

278
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:06,047
It has to go around.
She must have a shite nose.

279
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,747
Do you remember the Internet
at this speed?

280
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,787
Up all night and you'd see 8 women.

281
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:17,707
– Good nose.
– That is a good nose.

282
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:21,987
The mouth has to be wrong. There's gotta
be something wrong with her mouth.

283
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,127
Now that's a good looking woman.

284
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,807
Should I tell Jen we got a reply?

285
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,177
Roy?

286
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,237
Roy?

287
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:33,937
Roy!

288
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:36,597
Roy!

289
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:46,207
Hello, Daniel! I mean, hello.

290
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:51,047
Jen? Hello, it's Chris Tarrant from
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

291
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,627
Oh my God! Oh my God!

292
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:55,027
Chris Tarrant, hello!

293
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,247
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

294
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,577
Jen the next voice you hear
is gonna be Daniel's...

295
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,027
– Daniel's, Ok.
– But before I put you on with him,

296
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,027
he's asked me to ask you a question.

297
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,467
Okay, you can ask me a question.

298
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:10,797
Yeah, he wants to know if you'll go out
for dinner with him tomorrow night.

299
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,747
Oh really? Yes!

300
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,347
Yes, of course, I will!
Of course! Oh yes! Yes!

301
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,417
Yes, of course!

302
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:20,297
Yes, that's great, Jen.

303
00:15:20,867 --> 00:15:22,677
Now let me fill you in
on what's happening.

304
00:15:22,677 --> 00:15:26,067
Daniel's doing very well although
he has just used his 50/50.

305
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,587
Now, here's Daniel.
Daniel, you got 30 seconds.

306
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,417
Starting from... now!

307
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:31,987
– Okay, Jen.
– Hi, Daniel.

308
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,887
Yeah, hi Jen, Jen, okay...

309
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,867
who composed The Wooden Prince?

310
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:38,357
Was it A) Bartok, B) Chopin ?

311
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,787
Did you see
"I'm a Millionaire" last night?

312
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:49,237
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"
it's called. No, I didn't.

313
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,787
Well, you are not going to
Adam and beliEVE this.

314
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,127
Okay, do these make me
look like a bastard?

315
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,347
Why do you wanna look like a bastard?

316
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,807
I've got that date tonight,
she's expecting a monster.

317
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,807
Do these me make look like a bastard?

318
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:03,337
They make you look like an idiot.

319
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,067
– Anyway, did you see it?
– What?

320
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,437
"Do you want to be a Millionaire?"

321
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,147
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

322
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,637
"Who wants to be a person who is wrong?"

323
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,997
What's happened?

324
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,397
– If I may...
– Sure.

325
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,457
Guess who was on it last night!

326
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,027
– You!
– No, Daniel.

327
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,507
– King of men.
– Daniel was on "Millionaire"?

328
00:16:25,507 --> 00:16:26,557
Indeed he was, sir.

329
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,957
And it was the
"Do you want to phone a friend"...

330
00:16:29,007 --> 00:16:30,937
– It's just "Phone a friend".
– Anyway.

331
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:32,977
She was the "phone a friend"?

332
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,777
– She was the "phone a friend".
– You're the "phone a friend"!

333
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:36,767
What was the subject?

334
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:40,157
Classical music is the extraordinary
answer to that question.

335
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,437
So who of course is Daniel, our estimed
temp security guard, going to phone

336
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,157
but Jonathan Miller over here.

337
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,597
Think Daniel was on Millionaire.
Too bad it wasn't 50/50.

338
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:52,487
It was.

339
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,747
– And?
– I got it wrong.

340
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,267
I cost 31,000 pounds.

341
00:16:58,357 --> 00:16:59,887
It isn't funny though.

342
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:01,607
Now I have to go on a date with him.

343
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,607
Wow! The rules on that show
have really changed!

344
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,977
No, you don't understand.

345
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:07,467
He asked me out

346
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,567
on the show

347
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,527
before I got the question wrong.

348
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:13,167
It was all very romantic.

349
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:14,527
But now...

350
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,837
I don't think he likes me now.

351
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:20,137
And I don't wanna go out with
the biggest loser in England...

352
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:21,597
There you are!

353
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:22,787
Daniel...

354
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:24,637
– Hello.
– Hi.

355
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,047
– Gonna go for this meal then.
– Yeah.

356
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:30,637
Yeah, I can't wait.

357
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:33,447
I'm gonna take you to one
of my favourite restaurants.

358
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:34,517
Right.

359
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:39,207
I'll pay.

360
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,387
– It really is the least I can do.
– Oh yeah...

361
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:48,587
Oh my God!

362
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:50,407
Did you see that look?

363
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,787
I have a dinner date with that man.

364
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:56,867
If I'm not here tomorrow,
I want you to call the police.

365
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,037
Maybe not the best time to mention it,
but also you owe me 20 quids.

366
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,197
What? You got a response?

367
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,487
With the one that ended: "No dogs"?

368
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:05,747
Yep.

369
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,417
Oh my God, brilliant! More money gone!

370
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:09,907
Now the money that Daniel lost
wasn't really yours, was it?

371
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:12,347
It would have been
if I'd married him, Moss.

372
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:15,057
I need a good restaurant.

373
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,727
Maybe if he likes the food,
he won't beat me to death with a shoe.

374
00:18:19,217 --> 00:18:22,407
I thought you said you'd take him
to one of your favourite restaurants.

375
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:23,907
Haven't you got it yet?

376
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:25,437
That's what I do:

377
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,637
I lie...

378
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,057
I lie and I lie and...

379
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,147
I lie!

380
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,207
Well, I went to a good place recently.

381
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,137
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.

382
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:37,247
– Really?
– Yes. Why?

383
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,207
Sorry, I just didn't have you down
as a restaurant person.

384
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:41,367
I'm a restaurant person.

385
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:43,097
Why wouldn't I be a restaurant person?

386
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:44,267
Cheese string?

387
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,417
No, thanks.

388
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:47,627
What's this place called?

389
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,627
Messijoes.

390
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,267
– Is that French?
– French? No, it's English.

391
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,687
Okay, thank you, Moss. Yeah, I'll uh...

392
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:55,807
I'll give that a go.

393
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,657
Okay, I need a place to bring this girl

394
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:01,417
that says: "I'm a bastard."

395
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,717
Well, I went to a good place recently.

396
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,857
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.
It's got a bit of an edge.

397
00:19:06,857 --> 00:19:07,957
Yeah? What's it called?

398
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:08,957
Messijoes.

399
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,457
What is that? Spanish?

400
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:14,237
No! Spanish? It's English. Messijoes.

401
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:36,947
Okey dokey,
you get the firecracker nachos.

402
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,817
And you are getting
the prawn bites with spicy salsa.

403
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:49,037
This seems an unusual place
for someone like you to want to meet.

404
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:52,677
Yeah but...

405
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:57,457
everyone needs a place to come
to be alone.

406
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,797
Look at me! Yeah! Look at me!

407
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,217
Get a clown over here, please!

408
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,007
You're a loner?

409
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,847
I'm a loner all right.

410
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:13,757
I'm just a...

411
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:16,357
lonely loner

412
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,247
on a lonely road.

413
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:22,777
Alone.

414
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:25,977
Do you always wear shades?

415
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:27,437
Always.

416
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,537
They help me hide the fact

417
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,147
I'm always lying

418
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:34,957
to women.

419
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,227
Everyone is having having fun, fun, fun.

420
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,917
'Cause everything is nice
and everyone is friendly.

421
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,277
Lots of friendly faces
having fun, fun, fun.

422
00:20:51,277 --> 00:20:53,877
'Cause everything is nice
and everyone is friendly.

423
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,587
– Smile and the world will...
– Excuse me! Excuse me!

424
00:20:56,587 --> 00:20:59,917
It's just... It's not... Sorry,
it's just not appropriate at the moment.

425
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,967
You're that bloke off the telly!

426
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,657
And you must be the woman he phoned!
Brilliant!

427
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,767
Funniest thing I've seen in ages.

428
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:42,057
God! I'm a bastard!

429
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:45,137
Yes. So you keep saying.

430
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:47,847
Trouble... It's basically what I am.

431
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,167
Thank you.

432
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,417
You know something?

433
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,937
I don't think you're a bastard at all.

434
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:01,377
I am so.

435
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:03,737
I am a complete tool.

436
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,127
Oh my God!

437
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,417
No don't, don't! Don't hit him!

438
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:15,237
I know her.

439
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,367
Hey! What's going on?

440
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,987
Stay out of this, Fonzy!

441
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,397
You're fighting in front of kids!

442
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:25,367
I don't care!

443
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,407
You're a brute!

444
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:28,077
This bloke just insulted me!

445
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:31,607
Hey! Bit more careful
with the clown shoe there, Mister.

446
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,377
Just hold your head back.

447
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,037
Oh God!

448
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,517
He caught me by surprise.

449
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:51,297
When I see him tomorrow...

450
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,737
– That was his last day.
– Thank God!

451
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,707
Oh my God, look!

452
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,737
If you're coming,
can you just bloody hurry up!

453
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:00,497
– I'm coming! I...
– God's sake!

454
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:02,337
I just need to take my shoes off.

455
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:04,837
They look like such fruits.

456
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:11,437
– I'll call you a cab.
– No, no, it's fine.

457
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,817
– Taxi!
– I'll get my bus.

458
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,767
Don't be stupid, it's cold. Taxi!

459
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:16,477
– Here.
– Oh God.

460
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,477
Here you can have your 20 back.

461
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:22,137
I don't really think the bet
proved anything. Taxi!

462
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:37,197
Thanks, Roy.

463
00:23:37,947 --> 00:23:39,557
– I just want...
– Nice date!

464
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:46,607
Just a lonely loner
walking a lonely road.

465
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:52,527
Hi, girls.

466
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,657
My name is Maurice Moss.
Or Moss for short.

467
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,467
Sorry about the sound quality

468
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:00,347
but I'm having to do this
in the toilet of my mom's house.

469
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:02,967
She's watching
Diagnosis Murder at full volume.

470
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:04,597
And it drives me up the wall.

471
00:24:05,607 --> 00:24:09,387
Don't worry, though. I'm sitting on
the toilet but I'm not using it.

472
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:11,617
What?

473
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:12,617
– Moss?
– Yes?

474
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,167
What you doing in there?

475
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,087
Number 2s, leave me alone!

476
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,277
Don't forget to flush the toilet.

477
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,977
Don't clog it up like you usually do.

478
00:24:19,977 --> 00:24:23,237
I know! Just stop doing this!
You're always doing this!

479
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:24,997
You're making it going back in!

480
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:28,757
Now, my type...
