1
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:44,867
I know you won a party!

2
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,967
But I have to say thank you
to a few people

3
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:49,307
after what has been
a momentous week for this company.

4
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,507
Project Iccarus has increased
our productivity... 10 folds.

5
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,187
Every department is working
at three times usual speed...

6
00:00:57,217 --> 00:00:59,297
due to the increased interconnectivity

7
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:00,577
of our...

8
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,617
computer system!

9
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:04,507
Computers! Computers!

10
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,547
How could I talk about
all that computer stuff,

11
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:14,327
all... of that computer gobbledegook,

12
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,097
without... saying a word about...

13
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:18,247
the lawyers!

14
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,007
They cut the red tape!

15
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,287
They cut the red tape!
They cut the red tape!

16
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:24,167
– Come on!
– Yes!

17
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,117
That's enough!

18
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,997
And when you're talking about computers,

19
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,507
how can you fail to mention...

20
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:36,837
Accounts!

21
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:39,727
He's building up to us!

22
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,127
He must be!

23
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:43,867
And finally, last but not least...

24
00:01:44,107 --> 00:01:45,117
Champagne...

25
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:49,417
These three people proved,
time and again,

26
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:51,567
that they have...

27
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,327
the right stuff!

28
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,507
The toilet cleaners!

29
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,187
They said we couldn't do it!

30
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,627
They said outsourcing
our toilet cleaning

31
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:03,937
would be inefficient!

32
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:07,437
Derk, Banhead and Doodles
proved them wrong!

33
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:09,027
Toilets!

34
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:10,927
That's right Doodles!

35
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,137
Where are you going?

36
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:17,737
They do this every time.

37
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:19,757
They never remember us!

38
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,107
But... you did the work!

39
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:25,177
You did all the work!

40
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:29,057
So does this mean we're not going
to the "thank you" party?

41
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,007
Of course we're not going
to the "thank you" party!

42
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:31,617
Why would we go?

43
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:32,757
We weren't thanked!

44
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,147
Hello? I.T.,

45
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,957
have you tried turning it off
and on again?

46
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:41,047
Have you tried
sticking it up your arse?

47
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,757
I just realised that was my mother.

48
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,807
God! I was really looking forward
to that, you know.

49
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,417
Fancy to dance.

50
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,837
I'm glad the toilet guys
got the note, though.

51
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:57,947
They do good work.
Have you been to the toilets on 12th?

52
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,907
It's like going on holiday!

53
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:01,547
I now try not to go at home, now.

54
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,607
I save it up!

55
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:07,417
Oh Jesus! Will you please
do something about that poster?

56
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:08,477
What poster?

57
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:10,617
Bloody drawer!

58
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,997
That one! The one with the monkey!
It's horrible!

59
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,997
The monkey?
What's wrong with that monkey?

60
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,797
He's not horrible, he's lovely!
He's a lovely little monkey!

61
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:20,307
What's he doing! A goal!

62
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:22,777
Not that monkey!

63
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,467
That monkey...

64
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,937
Oh right. That is a bit frightening!

65
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,327
Anyway! I'd better fix this drawer.

66
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,427
Moss! Do you have the hammer?

67
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,777
You're not listening to me!

68
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:38,317
I hate it when people
don't listen to me!

69
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,097
– Oh God!
– Hey, that much!

70
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,487
Hyena screeching!

71
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:44,377
It's like someone's killing a cat
in here!

72
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:45,977
Some kind of shouty cat!

73
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,387
– What's going on?
– God!

74
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:48,817
Bring it down! Just bring it down.

75
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,267
I'm so, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm just...

76
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:52,897
I'm just a little bit...

77
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,027
You know...

78
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,647
– You know...
– What?

79
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,697
– What?
– Well, I've got...

80
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,547
– ...you know... at the moment so...
– What?

81
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:04,337
I've got Aunt Irma visiting.

82
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,747
I Do not like aunt Irma... I've got...

83
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,007
I've got an aunt like that!

84
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,697
It's my term for...

85
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,427
my time of the month...

86
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,607
What time of the month?
The week end?

87
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:18,717
No.

88
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,657
Does Aunt Irma visit on the week end?

89
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:21,707
– Moss!
– You know, it...

90
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:23,287
it's high tide...

91
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:25,127
– But we're not on the coast.
– Moss!

92
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,197
I'm closed for maintenance.

93
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,997
– Closed for maintenance?
– Moss!

94
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,337
I've fallen to the Communists!

95
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:34,967
Well, they do have
some strong arguments.

96
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:39,377
"Carrie", Moss,
first scene in "Carrie".

97
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,047
Yeah. You know, I...

98
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,967
People tell me I'm not great
during this time, so...

99
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,517
I felt I should warn you.

100
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,077
Right. "Not great" what way?

101
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,667
Just... I'm really...
not great to be around, so

102
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,897
– try not to get on my nerves.
– Oh yeah.

103
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,627
Hey, I've had a few girlfriends.
I'm not completely oblivious!

104
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:08,757
– You won't even know I'm here.
– Okay.

105
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,297
Oh! This is working right...
The afternoon is so great!

106
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,927
Look at that! So smooth!

107
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,517
Stop doing that!

108
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:20,457
Oh my God!

109
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,837
Sorry! Sorry, but you see what I mean!

110
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,027
You have to be careful.

111
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,317
Yeah! I'll be careful!

112
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:29,257
- Has she gone yet?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:31,317
What was all that about?

114
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,587
Goddamme! Ladies!

115
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,857
God bless them!
What would we do without though?

116
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,717
With their ways...

117
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:41,457
Their mysterious seasons!

118
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:42,907
The moon!

119
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,387
Glenn Close! Sheila Riston!

120
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,217
All the different kinds of women.

121
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,777
Smashing!

122
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:54,307
Oh my appointment.
I've got to go and see the psychiatrist.

123
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,847
I can't believe there's a psychiatrist
in the building.

124
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:58,637
All because those two from accounts

125
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:01,597
just had enough of everything
and wanted to go to the seaside.

126
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:02,747
The seaside?

127
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,657
They committed suicide, Roy!

128
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,427
That's right! Yes, of course.

129
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,127
Why do you have to go and see her?

130
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,297
Because I said Jen was dead, that time.

131
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,217
Oh yeah. Yeah. That'll be it.

132
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:19,637
She said it was something only
a severely disturbed person would do.

133
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,717
And that now, I have to spend
a lot of time in therapy.

134
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:23,917
Isn't that great?

135
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,257
Oh well, yes, that's...
That's clearly terrific.

136
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:27,417
No! No, that's bad!

137
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,097
Why do you think that's great?

138
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:32,887
The psychiatrist is a very...
attractive lady?

139
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:37,697
– I see... She's of the female...
– Genre? Yes.

140
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:40,197
A Dr. Melfi to your Tony Soprano?

141
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,267
She's a glamorous old woman.

142
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:44,707
Oh, the things you could learn
from her...

143
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,067
Or from any woman.

144
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:48,797
Is Jen is her office?

145
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,827
– I need to get her to sign something.
– Yeah.

146
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:53,897
Don't get on her nerves.

147
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,707
How would I get on her nerves?

148
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:06,927
Hello!

149
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,497
Shouldn't I be on the couch?

150
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,727
No, Maurice. Not today.

151
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:23,597
I've got some good news.

152
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,187
I think you've downed the corner.

153
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,837
I'm not going on the couch?

154
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,877
You don't need me any more, Moss.

155
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:29,867
What?

156
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,967
Well, there's obviously
nothing wrong with you.

157
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,927
And I think you're ready now
to do without our sessions.

158
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,297
But I've been feeling depressed!

159
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,177
Oh really? Why?

160
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:48,407
Because I'm pregnant.

161
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:50,067
What?

162
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,857
I mean...
I had a dream that I was pregnant.

163
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:55,777
Well...

164
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:57,977
There's nothing unusual about that.

165
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,567
But when I have the baby,

166
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,257
I looked down
and saw that it was my father!

167
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:08,307
– That's normal, Moss.
– Really?

168
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:10,287
That's the maddest thing
I could think of!

169
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,007
My mother? What if it had two heads?

170
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,397
Moss! Listen, I think you're fine

171
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,927
and there are other people here
who need me more.

172
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:18,967
But...

173
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,877
I've been having dark thoughts.

174
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,327
Dark thoughts?

175
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,967
Yes. Thoughts about dark things...

176
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:27,997
What sort of dark things?

177
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,897
Things that are dark...

178
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:32,627
Like what?

179
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,737
Darkness... night...

180
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,917
Things of the night...

181
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:40,517
Dracula...

182
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:45,187
You haven't been thinking
about self-harm?

183
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,087
Self-harm, yes! Harm!

184
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:49,447
Harm with the self.

185
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:52,297
Suicide...

186
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,117
For starters, yes.

187
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:56,387
Moss,

188
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:59,347
I do not think that you are suicidal.

189
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,467
Why? Why not? I tell you,

190
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,197
I'm at the end of my flipping tether!

191
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:06,887
Moss! It's not like you
to use that sort of language!

192
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,437
– Flip off!
– Moss!

193
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,717
For God's sake!

194
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:37,667
– Yes!
– Roy!

195
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,957
Sorry Roy! I may be speaking louder
at the moment

196
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,907
because I'm wearing ear-plugs.

197
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,667
Why are you wearing ear-plugs?

198
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:45,747
That's right!

199
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,537
– What?
– What's this contraption?

200
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:55,397
I'm... I'm stealing food
from this machine.

201
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:58,287
– Yeah!
– You know I do!

202
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:02,727
Oh, by the way, Roy, your work
on Project Iccarus was very good.

203
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:04,597
Well done, you did a great job! Thanks!

204
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:06,907
Yep? I can't hear you!

205
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,077
What's wrong with you?

206
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,007
Oh my God, you're crying?

207
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,527
I'm not crying! You're crying!

208
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,887
– What's wrong?
– Nothing's wrong!

209
00:10:29,887 --> 00:10:32,517
I'm fine! Will you stop getting at me?
You're always getting at me!

210
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,497
I'm not getting at you!
Stop shouting at me!

211
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,437
Why are these things
always so hard to open?!

212
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,747
Oh my God!

213
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,917
Wow, calm down, everybody!

214
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,647
What on Earth is going on?!

215
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,407
I don't know, I feel weird.

216
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:54,367
I've... I've been swearing
like a flipping docker!

217
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,407
Denholm's just thanked me
for Project Iccarus

218
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:00,547
and I started crying like an actress!

219
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,127
What's going on?!

220
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,767
Maybe it's all this stuff
that you both eat.

221
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,127
– Oh will you get off that?
– No, honestly, it's true!

222
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,467
Okay, Moss, what did you have
for breakfast this morning?

223
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:12,517
– Smarties cereals.
– Oh my God!

224
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:15,847
I didn't even know
Smarties made a cereal.

225
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,277
They don't.
It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk.

226
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,537
Case closed!

227
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,727
It's too much sugar, that's all!

228
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:25,387
No no! Hold on now!

229
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:27,157
I basically live on sugar

230
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,377
and we've never had
these problems before.

231
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,637
The only other explanation is...

232
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:35,407
No, no. It's silly.

233
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,567
What?

234
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:38,297
Well...

235
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,637
I feel ridiculous even saying it but...

236
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:43,427
Where I worked before,

237
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,377
there was me and a few other girls,
Liz and Susan and

238
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,267
whenever Aunt Irma was visiting me,

239
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:51,517
we all kind of...

240
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:54,287
synchronized.

241
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:56,927
What's that got to do with us?

242
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:58,607
Well...

243
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:00,237
– You think...
– Well maybe...

244
00:12:00,257 --> 00:12:02,357
– You're not saying...
– I know it sounds crazy.

245
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,147
Wow! You don't think
that Aunt Irma is visiting us?

246
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,427
The symptoms, Roy!

247
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,657
I am a man! He's a man! We're men!

248
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,537
Okay, okay! Tell me how you're feeling?

249
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,157
I feel delicate.

250
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,437
And... annoyed...

251
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:24,497
And...

252
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:26,867
I think I'm ugly.

253
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,877
That's her!

254
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,137
This is ridiculous!

255
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,327
I've never heard anything so...

256
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,647
bizarre in my life!

257
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,977
Oh stop shouting at her!
You're always shouting at her

258
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:39,687
and it's not fair! It's not fair!

259
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:58,257
You don't believe this theory, do you?

260
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,007
– No!
– No.

261
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:02,877
– It's non sense, isn't it?
– She's so silly!

262
00:13:03,237 --> 00:13:04,947
– Sugar!
– Yeah...

263
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:07,787
What?

264
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,347
That's not what's causing it.

265
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:10,737
You think it's Irma?

266
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,247
Yes. Don't you?

267
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,397
No!

268
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:15,927
I'm a man! We're men!

269
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:16,897
Well, if it's true,

270
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:18,987
it's the scientific breakthrough
of the afternoon.

271
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:21,287
It's not true!

272
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:23,017
Don't worry,
I wasn't about to look foolish

273
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,237
by jumping to conclusions,
so I've sent an e-mail out

274
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,597
asking everyone's opinions.

275
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:29,077
Right. Well, that's a good idea.

276
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,997
No, sorry.
Could you run that part to me again?

277
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,507
I've sent it to everyone
in my address book.

278
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:35,647
You should have one.

279
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:36,887
What?

280
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,127
Do we have PMT?

281
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,657
You sent this out?!

282
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,137
Oh you signed it from both of us!

283
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,787
You signed it from both of us!

284
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,627
Yes. Along with a list of symptoms.

285
00:13:49,757 --> 00:13:51,597
"Headachy", "Weakened",

286
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,457
"Irritability, anxiety!"

287
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:55,367
"Breast tenderness!"

288
00:13:55,497 --> 00:13:56,947
I get that, don't you?

289
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:57,937
Yes!

290
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,667
But you cannot tell
the entire I.T. community

291
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:02,117
that we have PMT!

292
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,927
Come on! No one would use
that sort of information against us.

293
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:07,197
Now, wait a second!
They would, wouldn't they? Oh no!

294
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,507
There's probably a whole website
devoted to us already!

295
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:13,327
Oh I only posted it about an hour ago.

296
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:14,557
Google our names!

297
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:16,417
Oh no!

298
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,347
What do we gotta do?

299
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,617
I don't know!

300
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,767
Come on! It's my turn with the bottle.

301
00:14:35,087 --> 00:14:37,747
God, sorry Richmond, sorry.
I always forget you work here.

302
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,637
Yeah. I seldom normally come out
this far, only

303
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,567
could you have a word with Moss and Roy?

304
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:46,607
Ever since they got famous,
they've been at each other's throats.

305
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,707
– Famous?
– Yes. Google their names.

306
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,777
Oh my God!
How many entries do they have?

307
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,077
Thousands...

308
00:14:57,227 --> 00:14:59,727
Mosse's e-mail's spreading
like a virus!

309
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,667
You've unleashed a monster
with that aunt Irma business.

310
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:07,247
Yes Richmond. Tell me,
how come Aunt Irma isn't affecting you?

311
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:10,277
Of course it is!
I've been feeling very gloomy all day!

312
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,357
Not my usual cheery self at all!

313
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:16,207
Yeah. I guess it's
just difficult to tell

314
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,407
underneath all that make-up.

315
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:19,657
I'm not wearing make-up!

316
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,697
Could you have a word?

317
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:25,217
They're driving me out
of my tiny little mind.

318
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,747
Guys! You gonna have to...

319
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,927
Oh my goodness!
What happened to your face?

320
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:36,787
We had an argument.

321
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:43,597
Oh God, have you seen this?
What's happening?

322
00:15:43,657 --> 00:15:45,477
The rioting has been going

323
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,787
on all night.

324
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:49,757
The men involved are young, angry and

325
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:52,517
almost all of them work with computers.

326
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,517
This is insane! What's going on?!

327
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:59,247
In Tokyo, two games designers

328
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,787
went on the rampage in a shopping centre

329
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,607
and frightened a dog!

330
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:07,067
In Hamburg, a group
of software developers

331
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:08,707
shouted at a bus.

332
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:12,297
The situation is completely
out of cont...

333
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,697
And it's all because of Aunt Irma.

334
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:15,807
But how?

335
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:19,077
You shouldn't have sent out this e-mail
detailing the symptoms.

336
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:22,157
You know how suggestible
and easily swayed I.T. people are...

337
00:16:22,207 --> 00:16:24,027
– That's not true!
– Yes it is!

338
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:25,497
No you're right. Of course it is.

339
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,087
You shouldn't have sent that e-mail,
Moss!

340
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,117
Oh don't blame me!

341
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:31,217
– It's your fault!
– Guys!

342
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,267
Guys, come on! You're fighting!

343
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:34,947
It's like you're in a trance!

344
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,737
No, you're right!
We shouldn't be doing this!

345
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,337
This is enough! We never fight!

346
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,287
We have to do something.

347
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,567
Yeah, whatever.

348
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,147
I'm going in.

349
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,637
Damn it Roy! I never thought
it would come to this!

350
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,137
The hell it has!

351
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:52,707
She's the only one that's had
direct contact with Irma.

352
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,587
If we can just calm her down then...

353
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,687
We can hope and pray
that everybody else calms down too.

354
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,917
You've got big balls, Roy!

355
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,567
Thanks.

356
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:06,907
You're very welcome.

357
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:11,527
Hiya!

358
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:14,237
Can't even find a bloody pen in here!

359
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,607
How is my soldier?

360
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,967
What do you want?!

361
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:19,827
I just came in for a little chat.

362
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,347
You are looking good today!

363
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:24,377
– Ah, thank you.
– So slim!

364
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:26,457
Yeah, I'm trying to stay in shape,
you know...

365
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,307
Oh your hair looks great!

366
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,637
Yeah. Hair conditioner.

367
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,557
The action on this is great!

368
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,177
Hello!

369
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:39,067
Hello Maurice.

370
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,977
I have to tell you
I've a little confession to make.

371
00:17:42,417 --> 00:17:45,047
As you may or may not know,
for ethical reasons,

372
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,817
I'm required not to have any...

373
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,557
relations with any of my patients.

374
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:55,177
But for the last few months,

375
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,737
I've been developing some

376
00:17:58,707 --> 00:17:59,787
warm...

377
00:17:59,897 --> 00:18:01,627
feelings towards you.

378
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,087
And the real reason
I terminated your therapy

379
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,847
was so that I could explore...

380
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,507
some of these feelings...

381
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,137
I see...

382
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:20,467
Jen,

383
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,327
I was just wondering,

384
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,477
when you were working
in your old job, with the girls,

385
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,947
if things ever got on top of you,

386
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,577
what would you do to...

387
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,927
relax?

388
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,147
We'd have a big girls' night out.

389
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,657
I'd love that actually.

390
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,247
A big girly night out!

391
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:44,787
There aren't chances of that round here.

392
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,147
Not necessarily.

393
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:52,777
Mom?!

394
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:00,837
This is my psychiatrist.

395
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,727
Oh! No. No, I'm... I'm sorry.

396
00:19:02,747 --> 00:19:04,047
It's just that you...

397
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,937
You look exactly like my mother.

398
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,587
No, no! But that... that...
don't be offended by that.

399
00:19:09,627 --> 00:19:12,127
She's... she's a very sexy woman.

400
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:16,467
Not not... not that I would want
to have sex with her...

401
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,387
I know that that's what
you psychiatrists think!

402
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,547
But I swear to God
that there's nothing to it in my case!

403
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:29,837
You know my mother wouldn't stand
for any of that kind of nonsense!

404
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,947
I can just hear her now...

405
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,217
"What are you doing Roy?"

406
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:36,857
"What are you doing?!"

407
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:42,347
You handled that well!

408
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:45,467
That's the psychiatrist!

409
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,767
Yes, I...

410
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,767
I think she's my girlfriend now.

411
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,117
No, Moss! Listen to me.

412
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,927
You can never see that woman again.

413
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,687
She looks exactly like my mother.

414
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,207
Oh stop it. You're exaggerating.

415
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,497
She's the spit of her!

416
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,287
Oh come on. What went on in there?

417
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:01,147
All right. Okay.

418
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,687
What would you say...

419
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,717
to a big girls' night out?

420
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:08,777
How big are the girls?

421
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,607
I can't believe I'd never seen
"Steel Magnolias"!

422
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:28,847
Oh my God! It's good, isn't it?

423
00:20:30,657 --> 00:20:33,087
– I know what we could watch next!
– Yeah!

424
00:20:33,547 --> 00:20:36,327
– Your really liked that film?
– Yes. Didn't you?

425
00:20:36,387 --> 00:20:38,567
No! It was heart-warming!

426
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,677
Well I feel like a princess, Roy!

427
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,757
And don't tell me
you don't feel the same!

428
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,997
Well, my breast-tenderness has gone.

429
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,857
No! What am I talking about?!
I'm a man! We're men!

430
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:52,247
It's the worst night of my life!

431
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:53,597
Hiya!

432
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:54,727
Okay!

433
00:20:55,477 --> 00:20:58,717
Beaches... or... Dirty Dancing!

434
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,907
Oh, Beaches! No! Dirty Dancing!

435
00:21:00,957 --> 00:21:02,497
– Oh I can't decide!
– Do!

436
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,057
God! Dear God!

437
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:05,917
I don't know which one to watch either!

438
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,617
Oh hey! But you know what we should do?

439
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,717
– What?
– Something else!

440
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,057
Oh! I know!

441
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:15,657
Why don't we go to the thank you party?

442
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,317
But I thought you didn't want to go.

443
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:18,887
Well, you know...

444
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:21,397
Everybody else is there,
and they did nothing

445
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,687
– and we did all the work!
– Yeah...

446
00:21:23,827 --> 00:21:26,287
– Screw them!
– Yeah! Screw them!

447
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,047
– Ok, come on! Let's go girls!
– Yeah!

448
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,677
Ok but first,

449
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:32,067
10 minutes of Beaches!

450
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:11,877
Oh Lord!

451
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,207
Oh yes, I suggest
I ask Dr. Mendall to join us.

452
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:18,527
What?

453
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:20,487
Moss! Over here!

454
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,207
What shall we do?

455
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:30,687
Nothing...

456
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,877
I just... I really need to get drunk.

457
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:34,967
Yeah, I'd like to get drunk.

458
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,817
– We should get drunk together then.
– Okay, yeah.

459
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,577
We should get so drunk
that we don't know what's going on.

460
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:46,877
All right.

461
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:56,477
...and, turned out,
4 dead cyclists on my fault!

462
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,277
Brilliant! Same thing I...

463
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,267
I.T. guys! Can we?!

464
00:23:41,427 --> 00:23:42,657
Oh dear.

465
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:53,437
Oh my God! I didn't!

466
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,217
I didn't!

467
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,577
Good morning!

468
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,267
I've made you a cup of tea.

469
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:13,187
Ah, thanks mom.

470
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,557
Mom?

471
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,617
That's interesting!

472
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:25,197
To be continued.
