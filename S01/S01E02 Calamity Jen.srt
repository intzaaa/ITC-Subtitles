1
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:34,443
The IT Crowd - 1x02 - Calamity Jen

2
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:51,699
Has this... ever happened to you?

3
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:10,136
From today, dialling 999
won't get you the emergency services.

4
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:12,599
And that's not the only thing
that's changing.

5
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,858
Nicer ambulances,
faster response times,

6
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:17,512
and better looking drivers

7
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,761
mean they're not just
the emergency services,

8
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,501
they're "your" emergency services. So...

9
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,280
Remember the new number:

10
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,637
That's...

11
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,744
Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble...

12
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:54,869
Well that's easy to remember!

13
00:01:54,968 --> 00:02:03,623
0118 999 881 999 119 725...

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,605
...3!

15
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,497
I don't know why
they just couldn't keep it as it was!

16
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,647
How hard is it to remember 911?

17
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:11,240
– You mean 999...
– I mean 999!

18
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:13,134
– That's the American one!
– Yeah!

19
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,948
– You berk!
– Come on, are you ready?

20
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,543
I don't know what to say really
it's fun...

21
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,296
there are some many issues in the world,

22
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:21,718
They are beautiful, I love them...

23
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:24,271
in fact they're the most beautiful shoes
I've ever seen but...

24
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,109
you know, I can't have everything
that I love,

25
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,476
otherwise I'd own lots of things,
and actually they're red,

26
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:31,637
which is quite tarty, and they don't
necessarily go with any of my outfits...

27
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,988
Come on you crazy bitch!

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,881
Come on!

29
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:36,913
Come on!

30
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:39,258
– Denholm's called the general.
– Oh God, another one!

31
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:39,847
Yeah!

32
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,623
I bet he declares war on something!

33
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,012
He loves declaring war!

34
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,702
I am declaring...

35
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:48,860
WAR!

36
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:54,511
I can see that got your attention.

37
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,554
What am I declaring war on?

38
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,276
My bollocks?!

39
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,890
Stress!

40
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:07,815
Stress is a disease, people,
and I am a cure!

41
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,859
I'm a doctor with a cure.

42
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,451
No, no! I'm a General!
And it's still a war!

43
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,232
A war on disease!

44
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,310
Stress!

45
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,326
There's too much stress around here.

46
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,443
They're very expensive and besides,

47
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:23,051
the woman in the shop said
they were way too small for me.

48
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,221
– You see you know, be practical, go on!
– In the time...

49
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,503
I've been speaking,

50
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:29,678
over 18 million people
have died of stress.

51
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:35,616
That's another one.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,690
That's another one.

53
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,237
More...

54
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,465
Mayhem!

55
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,051
We gotta deal with it!

56
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,716
– Are you ready to deal with it?
– Yeah!

57
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,386
Say: "I hate stress!"

58
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:53,536
– I hate stress!
– No!

59
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:54,994
You didn't let me finish.

60
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,722
Say: "I hate stress..."

61
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,374
and I want to limitate
its influence in my life,

62
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,663
what can I do about it? Anyone?

63
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,988
Have a bath?

64
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,449
Have a bath?

65
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:07,857
Get a bike!

66
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:10,610
I cycle to work... everyday!

67
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:11,974
70 miles!

68
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:14,053
Both here, and here...

69
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,373
are as red as a fire engine!

70
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,448
Any other ideas?

71
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:21,255
Jen, what about you?

72
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:22,225
Shoes!

73
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,313
– What?
– Shoes!

74
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,386
Well, shoes...

75
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:28,726
Ok, look!

76
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:31,473
I have invited Dr. Julian Holmes

77
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,090
to come and give a class at lunchtime.

78
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,124
He is Europe's leading stress expert.

79
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,398
They call him:" Stressperts!"

80
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:39,196
Anyone interested in coming along
picking up

81
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,696
a few tips on how to manage stress?

82
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,466
There's a free buffet...

83
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:49,907
Good!

84
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:51,687
Good people.

85
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,374
Oh! By the way!

86
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,906
Anyone still experiencing stress
at the end of the day...

87
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,534
will be fired!

88
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,369
It's not going on!

89
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:03,745
Yeah, I think it is so.
Just down angle it a bit more.

90
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:05,518
Are you sure you're a 5?

91
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,617
– I'm not a liar.
– Yeah, but I mean I can't...

92
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:09,846
Just... just...

93
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,955
I can feel the heel going into the shoe.

94
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,052
Just down angle a bit more...

95
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,496
There is no angle, but I could...

96
00:05:14,517 --> 00:05:15,729
Don't let me push you away!

97
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:17,445
Just lean in with the shoe. Lean in...

98
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,734
with the shoe!

99
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:19,531
Lean in!

100
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,412
We've been here... for half an hour.

101
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:35,283
The shoes aren't going on!

102
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,359
They're two sizes too small.

103
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,987
And even if they did go on,

104
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,278
they would cripple you.

105
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,331
You don't want that, do you?

106
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:02,733
I myself, have been subject to some...

107
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,176
terrible rages, but... Yes?

108
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,985
– I'm sorry. Is this the stress class?
– Oh yeah. Come on in.

109
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,229
Thank you.

110
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,168
Moss!

111
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,995
This is in here! Moss!

112
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,442
Just come in.

113
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,425
Thank you.

114
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,323
Ok.

115
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:16,408
Are you all right?

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,628
As I was saying...

117
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,497
I myself have been subject
to some terrible rages.

118
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:25,074
Where I've...

119
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:27,628
snapped at my wife, or spoken harshly

120
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:30,199
to a work colleague, because of stress.

121
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:34,312
If I... just... thinking about it now,
I realise I'm...

122
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,432
raising my voice.

123
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,215
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:39,537 --> 00:07:42,165
Stress is the main cause
of heart attacks.

125
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,284
And even a little bit... well...

126
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,713
Let me show you what stress can do.

127
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,473
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

128
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,785
Yes. Come on up.

129
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,371
That's fine. Can I have your left hand
there? The back?

130
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,025
And just relax there.

131
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,993
I'm gonna ask you
a very personal question.

132
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,478
There we are, you see?

133
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,541
Sorry, I'm not gonna ask you
anything at all.

134
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,747
That's just to show how little is needed

135
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,897
to send downstress levels shooting up.

136
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:19,367
Just a simple statement like that

137
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,353
is registered very strongly
on the display.

138
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:22,822
– Yes, another volunteer?
– Yeah.

139
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:23,538
Ok.

140
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:24,779
I'll have... just this off.

141
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,646
Ah! There it goes! Yes, raise up!

142
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,595
Look at that! Brilliant!

143
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:35,138
Brilliant, excellent!
It's a super machine!

144
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,836
Wow, great shoes!

145
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,000
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,484
I really envy women with dainty feet.

147
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,955
What are you? A five?

148
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,770
Yeah! Five...

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,032
Well, just a little
misunderstanding there I imagine. So...

150
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,021
– Huh let's move on... with...
– Wow!

151
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:04,803
I actually haven't had a proper go yet.

152
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,433
Well, I don't need attach... can't,
what's happened there...

153
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:09,203
Actually, I don't think that's fair...

154
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,401
I would like a go, and I think

155
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:13,045
Roy should be punished for
nearly killing that lady.

156
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,049
Well, I think I should go first!

157
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,117
I see, well let's move on...

158
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,858
– When did you grow a bit?
– A little go.

159
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,827
– We gotta move on...
– And I think we could...

160
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:21,103
Can we just move on?

161
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,121
You're old ? Are you very old?

162
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,223
Let's move on!

163
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,303
Oh! Shut up!

164
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:32,596
What are you eating?

165
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,857
Muffin.

166
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,758
A muffin? How can you be hungry,

167
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,841
you ate a whole chicken
at the stress buffet!

168
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,034
What's that?

169
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:42,022
Oh, I've made a stress machine

170
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,648
to try out for myself,
like the one in that class.

171
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:45,745
Watch this.

172
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,693
I'm going to ask myself
a very personal question.

173
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:56,269
Don't worry, I'm not really going
to ask myself any questions.

174
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,033
Pretty good.

175
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:01,954
Not as good as the one
in the stress class.

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,476
The shoes!

177
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,036
What was all that about?

178
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,904
Well, like all the women,
she's shoe mad!

179
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,464
It's a bit sexist, isn't it?

180
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:35,039
Do you know one woman
who isn't obsessed with shoes?

181
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,060
No, but I only know one woman.

182
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,388
And she just left the room shouting:
"the shoes!".

183
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:04,446
The needle's freaking out!

184
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:10,267
Try not to hurt yourself!

185
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,982
Moss?

186
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,189
Did you use a soldering iron
to make that stress machine?

187
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:19,969
Yes.

188
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,543
You turned it off?

189
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,811
Oh I'm fairly sure I did!

190
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:29,135
Because, you remember
what happened last time, right?

191
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,039
Yes! That was very funny!

192
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,370
Well no! No.

193
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,148
It was very dangerous
and someone nearly died!

194
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,311
Right! No! Yeah!

195
00:11:38,327 --> 00:11:41,234
I was thinking of a different incident.
The one on the golf course.

196
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:42,612
What?

197
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,435
I'm talking about the fire!

198
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:49,237
Oh yeah, fire sorry! I always
get mixed up between golf and fire.

199
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:52,322
– Just make sure it's off!
– It is off.

200
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:53,267
I think.

201
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,484
– Well just make sure it is.
– I will make sure it is.

202
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,952
And if it's already off...

203
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,202
I'll just walk away!

204
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:11,417
Will he get off my back! What is he?
The soldering iron police?

205
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,904
It's off...

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,571
that means I turn it... on...

207
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,889
and just walk away!

208
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,947
Four! I mean five!

209
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:53,327
I mean fire!

210
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:05,437
Now let's see what we have here.

211
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,097
"Stand upright."

212
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,067
Now, I can't read it...

213
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,727
Oh, not me!

214
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,097
I am a giddy-goat!

215
00:13:16,597 --> 00:13:17,467
Okay.

216
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,637
"Remove safety clip."

217
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:23,597
– Don't look at my feet!
– Fire?

218
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,317
Fire...

219
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:26,727
No...?

220
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:31,037
"Aim nozzle at base of fire."

221
00:13:36,427 --> 00:13:38,587
Oh, that is typical!

222
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:41,867
Why has it done that?

223
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,987
"Made in Britain"

224
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,557
I'll just put this over here,
with the rest...

225
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,197
of the fire.

226
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:05,337
011 53... No.

227
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,597
011 huh...

228
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:12,017
0118 999...

229
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,067
...3!

230
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,087
Hello? Is this the emergency services?

231
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,027
Then which country am I speaking to?

232
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,347
Hello? Hello?

233
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:28,627
I know! Yep.

234
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,147
Okay.

235
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,317
"Subject:..."

236
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:34,627
"...fire!"

237
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,747
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam."

238
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,947
"I'm writing to inform you of a fire

239
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,987
"which has broken out
at the premises of..."

240
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,457
No. That's too formal.

241
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,087
"Dear Sir", stroke, "Madam."

242
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,677
"Fire!", exclamation mark.

243
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:54,387
"Fire!", exclamation mark.

244
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,037
"Help me!', exclamation mark.

245
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,527
"123, Carendon road."

246
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,017
"Looking forward to hearing from you."

247
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:05,017
"All the best, Maurice Moss."

248
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:12,977
What are you wearing size 5 shoes for,
woman? You're at least an 8!

249
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:13,847
Eight?

250
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,107
How dare you?!

251
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,867
That foot is completely mangled.

252
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:20,317
And the other one's even worse.

253
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,287
You're not wearing these again.

254
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,627
But I threw away my other shoes,

255
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,887
what am I supposed to wear?

256
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:41,037
Hello! Hello!

257
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:44,067
Do you remember me?
Can I have a go in your machine now?

258
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:03,957
– Oh hello again!
– Hi!

259
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,687
Please thank Yamamoto San
for this fine ceremonial sword.

260
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:15,597
It is a magnificent symbol
of our new merger.

261
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,137
I am sorry that my gift...

262
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:22,087
a huge pair of Doc' Martins,

263
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,897
is extremely thick and heavy sorts.

264
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:27,257
It's so poultry in comparison.

265
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,527
Please rest assured
that my cultural advisor will be fired

266
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,447
as soon as this meeting is over.

267
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,277
– These are very heavy shoes.
– Yes.

268
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,797
He feels like... Godzilla!

269
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:54,387
Does he?

270
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:55,167
Godzilla!

271
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,027
Go on! Stamp your feet!

272
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:58,477
Clap him man!

273
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,317
Good!

274
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,147
Oh yeah! The Jap loves it!

275
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,807
Go on! Break something!

276
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,687
Put your weight into it!

277
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,957
You idiot!

278
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,217
You stupid old...

279
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:20,277
You...

280
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:23,217
and your big... shoes!

281
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:28,487
Oh you're not! You're nothing

282
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:58,647
– I am... so... sorry, Denholm.
– That was quite a tarring Jen.

283
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,497
It would have been even worse

284
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,107
if Paul hadn't been so quick
on the profanity buzzer.

285
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:04,857
Well done, Paul!

286
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:05,907
You're back on the payroll.

287
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,757
As for you... you're fucked up!

288
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,687
Shouting at Japs! Mad feet!

289
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,667
Both classic signs of stress!

290
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,627
And you know how I feel about stress...

291
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:18,147
Go to your office, and wait for me.

292
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:32,207
Weirdest thing just happened... Fire!

293
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:33,687
Fire!

294
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:35,597
I've sent an e-mail. It's fine!

295
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,367
An e-mail?! It's a fire! Where...

296
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,247
Where is the precinct extinguisher ?

297
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:48,897
– Made in Britain!
– This is just like the golf incident!

298
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:50,087
You mean the fire incident?

299
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,397
I mean the fire incident!
Of course I mean the fire incident!

300
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,407
What have you got there?

301
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:54,917
Oh I'm in trouble! I'm in real trouble!

302
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,857
Help me get my shoes on!
I gotta get my shoes on!

303
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,647
Help me get my shoes on
before Denholm comes!

304
00:18:58,677 --> 00:18:59,837
– Denholm's coming?
– Yeah.

305
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,587
And he's got a... fire! Fire! Fire!

306
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:04,967
I've taken care of it.

307
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,427
I have to say I feel a little bit
insulted

308
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,387
by the lack of faith you both display.

309
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:11,077
What happened to your feet?

310
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:11,897
What is this?

311
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,537
I think a fire in the office

312
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,197
demands a little more attention
than my feet, don't you?

313
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,257
How... how did you get
the stress machine Roy?

314
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,267
I... don't really know.

315
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:23,337
Met Dr. Holmes by the lift.

316
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:25,717
Wasn't he nice?
I thought he was a lovely man.

317
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,357
Yes I thought he was a delight.

318
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:32,537
But I met him there by the lift,
and he just went... mental!

319
00:19:33,557 --> 00:19:37,647
And one thing led to another
and I just... stole it!

320
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:40,357
– You stole it...
– Yeah!

321
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:42,677
But that's stealing!

322
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:44,307
Yeah!

323
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,527
Didn't know what a stress machine was
this morning and now we have 2 of them.

324
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,767
I hate to remind everyone but

325
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,017
I've just destroyed a merger

326
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,997
that probably took hundreds of years
to set up,

327
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,587
the office is on fire,
Denholm is furious, so

328
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:57,657
could we please concentrate
on what's important,

329
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:00,077
and help me out with my shoes!

330
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:01,777
That could get you into trouble!

331
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,797
Empty!

332
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,847
Got a little bit there!

333
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:09,957
Oh quick! No, no! Quick, no!

334
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,617
These are a size 5...

335
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,487
What are you, eight and a half?

336
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:14,747
Shut up!

337
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,467
– Come on!
– I'm pushing!

338
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,317
Push it! Oh don't let me push you away!

339
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:20,227
– Is it in?
– Come on!

340
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:21,937
Push hard guy!

341
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,197
The heel went right through!

342
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,437
Oh my God it hurts so much!

343
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,997
– Oh now, I'm bleeding!
– Jen!

344
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,307
– Where are you Jen?
– It's Denholm!

345
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,467
What?

346
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:38,177
Hide the stress machine!

347
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,807
The stress machine?
What about the fire?!

348
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,067
Ok! Put the stress machine
in Jen's room!

349
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,027
– He'll never go in there!
– But what if he does?

350
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,757
It doesn't matter!
He won't know what it is!

351
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,547
I can't go to prison Roy!

352
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,377
They'll rape the flip out of me!

353
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:56,007
You! Stall him by the door!

354
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,587
I stall... How?

355
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,327
I don't know! Use your womanly ways!

356
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,067
Ok Moss! Pass me that monitor screen.
The broken one.

357
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:06,167
There you are!

358
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:07,677
Hello there!

359
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:10,097
It's no use being womanly with me Jen!

360
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:11,857
You're in big trouble!

361
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:14,687
Nice screensaver!

362
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:18,977
Thank you.

363
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:24,557
A stress machine!

364
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,187
Just what we need!

365
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,117
Roll up your sleeves, Jen.

366
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,487
Let's get this over with.

367
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,687
It's a one way ticket
to slammer town for us Roy.

368
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:36,287
With no return ticket!

369
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:42,407
I really am losing quite a lot of blood!

370
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:44,347
You understand this is your last chance?

371
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:45,977
If the needle goes beyond here...

372
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:47,377
you will be fired!

373
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:49,897
Does that make you feel stressed?

374
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,037
Jen! Does it?

375
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:53,587
No? Are you sure?

376
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:54,637
Are you sure?

377
00:21:55,017 --> 00:21:55,957
Are you sure?

378
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,027
Are you sure?

379
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,217
Are you sure?

380
00:21:58,547 --> 00:21:59,477
Are you sure?

381
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:00,667
Are you sure?

382
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:01,957
Are you sure?

383
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:03,087
Are you sure?

384
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:04,457
Are you sure?

385
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,577
Are you sure?

386
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:06,767
Are you sure?

387
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,387
I'll level with you Roy.

388
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:11,067
I don't think I'd flourish
in a prison environment.

389
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,757
Could I try on your new glasses?

390
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:17,457
See this balloon, Jen?

391
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,337
I'm gonna burst it.

392
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,037
But I'm not gonna tell you when...

393
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,977
Do you feel stressed Jen? Jen? Jen?

394
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:26,027
Look at that!

395
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,887
That's your peace of mind!

396
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:30,307
And it's gonna go bang!

397
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,167
Do you feel stress now, Jen?

398
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:33,777
Jen!

399
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:39,017
Jen! Jen! Do you?!

400
00:22:40,587 --> 00:22:41,837
Evidently not.

401
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:44,787
Well done Jen!

402
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,167
You're not being fired by me...

403
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:48,847
at this precise moment.

404
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,907
I love the way the smoke
seems to be coming off the top of it.

405
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:00,817
Just a second...

406
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:04,727
I'm late for golf!

407
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:14,227
I wonder why it didn't work...

408
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,177
"Made In Britain"

409
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,867
I don't know if it's the loss of blood

410
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:26,897
or the melting plastic from the monitor
but I feel great!

411
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:33,417
It's so ironic but this entire situation
has been quite stressful.

412
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,507
I'll get help...

413
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:42,197
You sent an e-mail about a fire?
