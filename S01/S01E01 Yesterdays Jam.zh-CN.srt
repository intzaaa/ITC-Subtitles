1
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,520
珍，希望这不会让你感到尴尬

2
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,600
但我发现评估新员工最好的方式

3
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,570
就是以严厉的目光凝视他们

4
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,720
— 所以！
— 所以

5
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,200
— 第一天！
— 对！

6
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,620
— 感到害怕？
— 是的……

7
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,820
— 不要害怕！
— 我其实没有害怕

8
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,400
你应该会感到害怕

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,650
— 嗯我是有那么一点点害怕
— 啊？别怕！

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,650
你说了算吧！

11
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,620
一定期待已久了吧！

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,220
是

13
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,900
我…… 非常期待……

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,320
— 可以开始了解……
— 我准备把你放到IT部门

15
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,670
因为你在简历里说你对计算机有很丰富的经验

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,170
我在我的简历中是有提到，确实。

17
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,120
我对整个计算机领域有着……

18
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,650
非常丰富的经验…… 你知道的，电子邮件……

19
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,350
发送邮件，接受邮件,
删除邮件...

20
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,870
– 我还能继续说下去
– 说下去！

21
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,150
万维网…… 使用鼠……
鼠标…… 用鼠标

22
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,520
单击…… 双击……

23
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,800
当然还有屏幕，键盘

24
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,320
那个放在地下的小东西……

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,620
— 硬盘？
— 对的

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,450
看来，你确实对你的工作十分了解

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,300
没别的问题了
我看好你，珍！

28
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,900
而且他们需要一个新的主管

29
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,350
太好了！

30
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,420
所以…… 那些将和我一起工作的人，
都怎么样呢？

31
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,970
标准的书呆子！

32
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,520
你好，I.T.

33
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,850
你有没有试过把它关掉再打开？

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,870
好，那么，侧面的按钮，是亮着的吗？

35
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,550
嗯，你需要把它打开！

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,550
那个按钮，把它打开？！

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,190
嗯…… 你…… 嗯……

38
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,550
你不会连怎么按按钮都不知道吧？

39
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,620
不，不是在衣服上的！

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
你好，I.T.？

41
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,950
Yeah?

42
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,300
你是否尝试过意外强制重启？

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,020
不不不！可以了！不，已经可以了，
我刚听到它启动了

44
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,720
不不不，那是它启动的声音

45
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,350
不是，那是它启动的……

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,700
对不起，你是从古代来的吗？

47
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,150
看起来是驱动程序通过修改系统调用表来挂钩函数

48
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,570
而这时重载它是不安全的

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
除非另一个线程正要插入那里
并执行它自己的任务

50
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,550
你也不想最终进入无效内存里面吧

51
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,450
你好？

52
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,150

Really? Really, why don't you come
down here and make me then?

53
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,000
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,750
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for ya!

55
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,320
That told her!

56
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,470
Oh God, it's about time you got back,
it's been all go.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,300
You had a job?

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,200
Girl on fifth...

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
你和她…… 一拍即合了吗？
Did you and her... hit it off?

60
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,110
定义“一拍即合”？
Define "hit it off"?

61
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,770
她在你修好她的电脑之后继续和你聊天吗？
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

62
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:37,900
没有……
No...

63
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,550
而且在我修她的电脑的时候，她把一个杯子放在我背上
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,250
— 不是吧？！
– No?!
—— 是的！
– Yep!

65
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,070
难以置信！
Unbelievable!

66
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,950
是的，他们对我们一点都不尊重，一点也没有！
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us
up there, no respect whatsoever!

67
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,470
我们对他们来说只是干苦力的
We're all just drudgens to them.

68
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,450
对！
Yes!

69
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,470
如果有这么一个词叫“干苦力”
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

70
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,950
那就是我们对他们的意义
that is what we'd be to them.

71
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,320
每当他们的打印机出问题的时候
It's like they're pally-wally

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,770
他们就像好朋友一样
when there's a problem
with their printer

73
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,100
但一旦问题解决了……
but once it's fixed...

74
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,420
他们就把我们抛在一边，就像隔夜的果酱一样！
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

75
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,000
对！
Yes!

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,400
隔夜的果酱！
Yesterday's jam!
这就是我们对他们的意义！
That is what we are to them!

77
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,470
其实你知道吗？
Actually you know what?
这个说法并不太恰当……
That doesn't really work as a thing...

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,420
因为你知道的，果酱可以保存很久……
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,370
你好，I.T.？
Hello, I.T. ?

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,320
你有没有试过把它关掉再打开？
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

81
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,500
中性厕所？你们有中性厕所，就像《艾莉的异想世界》里面那样？
Unisex toilets? You have unisex toilets,
like Ally McBeal?

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,100
这就是这个地方的情况，珍
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,470
很多性感的人，不怎么工作…… 还有一些婚外情
A lot of sexy people not doing
much work... and having affairs.

84
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,620
哦我的天啊！看那个景色！
Oh my God! Look at that view!

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,100
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,170
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.

87
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,420
Floor 34.

88
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,970
Great sir, thank you.
OK. Where am I going?
y'y
89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,090
All... the way down to the basement.

90
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,320
Good luck!

91
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,150
Get out of the lift...

92
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,220
– Oh. Won't be a tick!
– Oh my God!

93
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,700
Oh my God! Oh God! OK.

94
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,220
Hello?

95
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,700
Hello?

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,050
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

97
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,180
I'm sorry, myself and Morris
were just engaged

98
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,350
in quite a serious discussion
about books and such.

99
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,200
We didn't hear you come in.

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,370
Wait a second, you said it was
Tolstoy, he said what?

101
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,370
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,070
When have you read Tolstoy?

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,700
Shut up, Morris!

104
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,630
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

105
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,000
When did... I don't remember
this conversation at all!

106
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,640
Don't... don't let me disturb you,
I just wanted to come down....

107
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,320
Don't be silly you never dist...

108
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,550
Many people come down here to visit!

109
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,350
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

110
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,670
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?!

111
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,470
So... What can we do you for?

112
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,870
I'm the new head of this department.

113
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,270
Is this my office?

114
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,900
Why? What did she... Did she just say...

115
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,440
– I am the head of this department!
–  I thought I was.

116
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,320
It's one of us! Certainly not her!
I'm gonna sort this out...

117
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,750
Roy! You've got a head wound there...
Head wound!

118
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,220
Hi!

119
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,370
I don't wanna be rude or anything

120
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,620
but I wasn't informed of any changes
to this department.

121
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

122
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,670
No!

123
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,250
And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much,

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,550
we're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

125
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,500
Sure... sure...

126
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,970
You know you're covered in blood?

127
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,750
Moss!

128
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,850
Amazon thingy.

129
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,460
Wicked!

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,870
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

131
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,050
I got the child edition
and the adult edition

132
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,770
just to check that there are
no differences in the text.

133
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,100
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able
to deal with that woman!

134
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,480
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!

135
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,050
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.

136
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,220
Come in!

137
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,310
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

138
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,600
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

139
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,500
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

140
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,670
Yeah, I know.

141
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,920
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

142
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,640
Ok!

143
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,950
Ok, take care, take care!

144
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,220
Ok bye! Bye!

145
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh, so, hello!

146
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,720
What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

147
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,420
Hello. I was just wondering...

148
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,670
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

149
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,870
No no no... No.

150
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,200
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.

151
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,540
But how?!

152
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,170
Oh do you mind... Do you mind
closing the door for me?

153
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,850
– Oh yeah, sure.
– Yeah, Ok.

154
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,750
Yeah. From the other side...

155
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,600
Of course.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,820
– Like this?\
– That's it!

157
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,500
– With me on the...
– Thanks!

158
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
Are you all right?

159
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,270
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,780
The nurse said I didn't do myself
any serious damage.

161
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,020
I'm standing over here!

162
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,200
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

163
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,220
What we gonna do about her?

164
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,670
Well, I just went in, and she was having
a pretend conversation.

165
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,970
– Really?
– Yes.

166
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,900
She's a little bit weird...
to say the least.

167
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,750
What's that?

168
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,070
Oh just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

169
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,400
and this helps cool it down.

170
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
She is quite the oddbod...

171
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,150
Did you notice how
she didn't even get excited

172
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,370
when she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

173
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,170
Yeah, that was weird.

174
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,700
It's almost as if she doesn't know
anything about computers.

175
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,520
What?!

176
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,350
Look what you did!

177
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,920
Oh don't worry that's why
I always make 2 cups of tea.

178
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,720
Anyway, what were we talking about?

179
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh, her not knowing anything
about computers.

180
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,170
What?!

181
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,190
I definitely want to get rid of her.

182
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,620
I agree yeah.

183
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,840
Ok, so, here's the plan:

184
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,570
A plan? Let me put on
my slightly larger glasses.

185
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,350
Ok, hit me!

186
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,850
– Ok. We go in...
– When?

187
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,520
You know, like in a minute.

188
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Will that be enough time for me
to get to know the plan?

189
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,630
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!

190
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,820
I... I've clearly gotten you
over-excited!

191
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,730
Would "steamed" be a better word?

192
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,370
Although that's just as exciting,
I might even use these.

193
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,770
All I was gonna say was...

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,290
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks
about computers

195
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,470
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

196
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,640
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

197
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,960
Let me do the talk.

198
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,640
All right.

199
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,590
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

200
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,330
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

201
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,590
We... we need to stay calm.

202
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:18,130
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

203
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,750
Hang on, guys.

204
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,620
How can I help?

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,460
Well, we were just wondering
now that you're "The Boss",

206
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,740
would you like us to access
the data supplier

207
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,130
and connect you up to the matrix?

208
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,660
You just made all that up?

209
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,180
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

210
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,240
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there,

211
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,060
and do some work, to do with computers!

212
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll be in there in a minute
and check up on you!

213
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,300
Ok, lady!

214
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,950
You've won this round, but we can wait!

215
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,190
You will slip up one day,

216
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,710
and believe you me,
we will be there when you do!

217
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,760
There will be some piece of evidence
that will prove

218
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,900
without any shadow of a doubt

219
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,760
that you don't know
anything about computers.

220
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,930
What are you doing?

221
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,150
Plugging in your computer.

222
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,280
It might be something you say...

223
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,890
or something you do!

224
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,910
But when we notice this,
and believe me we will notice this,

225
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,510
there's gonna be a long way down
for you, sweet chicks!

226
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,410
He'll realize in a second...

227
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,450
I cannot believe you're going
to tell on me.

228
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,970
You're like a pair of horrible
old women.

229
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,820
What did she say?

230
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,440
She said we're like horrible old women.

231
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,720
She didn't!

232
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,600
Hey guys!

233
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Ok, got something to tell me?

234
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,780
Yes, well, it's like this:

235
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,240
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

236
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,620
– Yeah.
– Team players each and every one of you.

237
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,630
Yeah, what she...

238
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,650
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team!

239
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,710
Excuse me.

240
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,650
Hello?

241
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,050
What?!

242
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,700
Well if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired!

243
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,880
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!

244
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,610
Hello, Security?

245
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,720
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

246
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,470
Escort them from the premises.

247
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,590
And do it as a team!

248
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,270
Remember you're a team, and if you can't
act as a team, you're fired too!

249
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:35,770
Dawn!

250
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,600
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team

251
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,300
that can work as team.

252
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,350
They may have to escort our
security team from the building,

253
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,250
for not acting like a team!

254
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,830
Team! Team team team team team!

255
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,890
I even love saying the word "team".

256
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,520
You probably think that's a picture
of my family?

257
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,030
It's the A-Team.

258
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,790
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

259
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,350
All of them!

260
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,670
So what do you wanna tell me?

261
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,810
Well, it's just not working out.

262
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,660
– He's joking!
– But you said...

263
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,770
Not working out?

264
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,500
Oh no! No!

265
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,930
We are getting on like
a big house on fire!

266
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,780
– Yeah!
– My ear's getting hot!

267
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,600
No... You know what?
We should leave, now, because

268
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,060
you know, you're a busy man

269
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,090
and we've taken far too much
of your time.

270
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,900
Jen could you just get the door
for me there?

271
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
Absolutely Roy!

272
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,720
So why did you come here
in the first place?

273
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,220
We set up a voice activation system
on your computer.

274
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,800
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

275
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,550
It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice

276
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,700
but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!

277
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
– Bye bye!
– Thank you!

278
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,250
How exciting!

279
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,760
Hello...

280
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,340
Hello computer!

281
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,220
Hello!

282
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,040
Hello... Hello computer...

283
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,730
What good are you?

284
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,350
You obviously don't know anything
about computers.

285
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,750
No but... OK.

286
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,140
But I can learn.

287
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,100
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

288
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,070
you could take me through
what you're doing right now.

289
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,670
I'd be delighted!

290
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,840
I'm just working on a very simple piece
of programming code.

291
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,440
I see...

292
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,380
Oh God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!

293
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,680
I don't know anything
about computers, I mean...

294
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,420
I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.

295
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,050
Hi! Is... Roy around?

296
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,820
Hello there little lady!

297
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,380
Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.

298
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,200
You wanted me to come down?!

299
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,370
Well here I am!!

300
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,770
Not the face!!

301
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,820
Not the face!!

302
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,340
Well maybe this will teach you

303
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,900
to treat people with
a little bit of respect!

304
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,090
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone
earlier?

305
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,780
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

306
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,440
Yes!

307
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,240
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

308
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,490
No! Got them in a sale.

309
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,810
Oh God! Clever you!

310
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm never lucky enough
to get a bargain myself.

311
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,310
Well, I should take you shopping.

312
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,270
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

313
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,740
Oh I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you! Take care!

314
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,330
– Nice meeting you!
– Chairman! Wow!

315
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,870
You just diffuse that entire situation!

316
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,900
What situation?

317
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,470
Oh, that.. yeah!
Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

318
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,620
They're fairly regular,
the beatings, yes.

319
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,100
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

320
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,830
Ah it's not all that bad!

321
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,560
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

322
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean...

323
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,220
I'm a people person and...

324
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,910
people like you need a person
to deal with people...

325
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,590
a people person like me. Oh my God!

326
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,480
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!

327
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,540
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

328
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,860
if I told you that I had a plan

329
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,920
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?

330
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,920
I can't be done! You're crazy!

331
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,690
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out! Ok!

332
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,170
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

333
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,510
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY

334
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,570
No no! Oh no, really really really,
that was a true story!

335
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,010
Unbelievable!

336
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,090
I said why we don't go out
with the I.T. guys more often?

337
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,420
– You're hilarious!
– Yes we are!

338
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,870
You guys should come down here
more often you know,

339
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,570
you should see this as a new era
for Reynholm Industries.

340
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,460
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

341
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,940
Do you know what! If you want
to hear something really funny,

342
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,100
a really funny story,

343
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,800
you should hear what happened
to Moss and I,

344
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,490
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

345
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,430
that Moss lost his glasses!

346
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,660
Moss! Moss!

347
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,260
Come here! Come here!

348
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,170
Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

349
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,850
Really?

350
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,450
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

351
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,290
Oh this a great story,
you're gonna love it!

352
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

353
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,510
Well go on, then.

354
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,410
All right.

355
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,560
– Well, one night, we were really drunk.
– Yeah.

356
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,800
And huh, we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

357
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,750
And when they arrived to the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

358
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,530
so we brought them to the fair.

359
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,310
Oh really nice! In the end,
they only charged us half.

360
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,440
But we did have to pay
for all the rides.

361
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,730
噢难道这不是最棒的故事吗？
Oh isn't that just the best story?

362
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,370
哦各位！
Oh, man!

363
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,830
你告诉过我不要把这件事告诉任何人
You told me to never tell that story
to anyone.

364
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,110
啊，你在说什么呢？
Well, what're you talking about?
这是一个绝妙的故事！
That's a brilliant story!

365
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,760
后来你几乎要走到水沟里去
And then you nearly walked
into the canal!

366
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,620
Has it got to that part
with the boatman?

367
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,420
你说的是我丢了我的眼镜的那个故事吗？
Do you mean the story
when I lost my glasses?

368
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,450
对啊！
Yes!

369
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,170
你觉得我说的是什么故事？
What story did you think I mean?

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,65
莫斯？
Moss?

371
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,320
你说了什么？！你说了什么？！
What did you say?! What did you say?!

372
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,710
这就很适合你们两个
It's all right for you two.

373
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,800
You're used to being social social piranhas...

374
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,540
我一般是个很受欢迎的人
I'm a very popular person usually.

375
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,950
之前那个，想用她的鞋子把我打死的女孩
That girl earlier, that tried
to beat me to death with her shoes,

376
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,540
有人有她的电话号码吗？
did anybody get her number?

377
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,990
讲道理这真是美好的一天，不是吗？
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

378
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,800
With Brandy and Crystal!

379
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,450
你好，I.T.？
Hello I.T.?

380
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,820
嗯，你有没有试过把它关掉再打开？
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

381
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,070
你好！你好！
Hello! Hello!
