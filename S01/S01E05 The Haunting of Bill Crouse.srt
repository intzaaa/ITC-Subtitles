1
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:34,100
The Haunting of Bill Crouse

2
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:34,897
OK.

3
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,257
Here we go.

4
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:43,157
Sit properly?

5
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:46,247
Cheers.

6
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:48,577
Bill?

7
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:50,897
Mick Hucknall.

8
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,027
Hey, this is fun.

9
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:00,577
– It's been a good night so far.
– Yes, it's been really good, yeah.

10
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,757
Yeah, I'll be honest,
when Julie suggested

11
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:04,267
we get together, I was like no.

12
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,737
you know, I get set up a lot

13
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:08,697
by friends, and it never works out.

14
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:09,977
Tell me about it. Me too.

15
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,987
You know, I hate dates usually.

16
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:15,327
They should call dates
"Spend some time with a big fat loser!"

17
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,287
But this has been brilliant.

18
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:20,427
Hey...

19
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,207
I was thinking, afterwards,

20
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,707
maybe you'd like to

21
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,047
come back to my place?

22
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,047
We could listen to the new
Jamie Cullum album.

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,237
Maybe, yeah!

24
00:01:28,347 --> 00:01:30,447
Yeah, yeah, that'd be...
really nice actually.

25
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,597
Great.

26
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,887
Let me guess...

27
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:36,577
You're a...

28
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,127
red wine person?

29
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:39,437
Yes, yes I am!

30
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,967
I would be too, if we could get
some service round here!

31
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,267
Yeah, you, Hucknall.

32
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:48,367
When you, when you Simply Ready?

33
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:51,357
Unbelievable.

34
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:52,907
Oh, I should say, um,

35
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:54,457
I don't really like sharing.

36
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,247
So you get what you want,
I'll get what I want

37
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:00,267
we leave it at that.
I just think it's a lot less confusing.

38
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:01,517
Sure, sure.

39
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:02,977
– Did you say Jamie Cullum?
– Yeah.

40
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,297
I hate Jamie Cullum.

41
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,117
Oh, and, just to say,

42
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,237
"I don't really like sharing."

43
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,527
With the rising inflection
and everything.

44
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:16,157
In a tapas restaurant,
he doesn't like sharing.

45
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,097
What the heck is tapas?

46
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,217
You know, tapas,

47
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,497
– tiny food from Spain.
– Oh, yes.

48
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:24,107
– Teipas.
– Yeah, that's no how you say it.

49
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,807
Yes it is.

50
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,877
You're a teipas.

51
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,197
What else? What else?

52
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,347
What else?

53
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:33,497
Oh God, you should have seen him
with the waiters.

54
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,067
– Rude?
– Unbelievable!

55
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:37,007
Oh yeah, I used to work as a waiter.

56
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,737
If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to
carry their food around in my trousers.

57
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:44,027
Oh my God! Before you brought it
to their table?

58
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:46,257
No, after.

59
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:50,197
Of course before!
Why would I do it after?

60
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,227
Do you think they did that to him?

61
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:54,587
Okay, well. While he was eating,

62
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:56,187
did you ear anyone laughing?

63
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:58,167
Like... in the kitchen area.

64
00:02:59,117 --> 00:02:59,957
Yes!

65
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,627
Yes I did, actually, yes I did.

66
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:03,017
That'll be trouser food.

67
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,297
– Oh God!
– Yeah.

68
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:06,427
Probably a good thing
you weren't sharing.

69
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,547
My God!

70
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,127
I could have saved you the trouble.

71
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:11,307
That guy is famous, he's a mouth.

72
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:12,557
They call him "The News"

73
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:14,827
because he was always talking about
who he slept with.

74
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:18,887
I would honestly rather sleep
with a rat.

75
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,007
Literally.

76
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,747
The thing I cannot understand yet, this:

77
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:26,517
this is a man Julie on 5th
thinks is perfect for me,

78
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:27,707
I mean what was she thinking?

79
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:28,587
Wait a second.

80
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,157
– Who do you know on 5th?
– Why?

81
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:32,017
What was the name,
was it Judy or Julie?

82
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,127
Why do you need to know?

83
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,137
No reason.

84
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:35,997
Lots of nice looking girls on fifth.

85
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,727
Looking for an in, aren't we?

86
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:38,887
An in? No!

87
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,127
Thank you, no.

88
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,047
Don't use my name
to start leching around on 5th.

89
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,197
For your information, I do not lech

90
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:49,107
I have a little more class than that,
thank you very much.

91
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,067
– Post.
– Thank you.

92
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:52,637
Oh no, this is wrong.

93
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,377
A lingerie catalogue
for a Cathy Morgan Foreman.

94
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,067
I'll make sure that Cathy gets it.

95
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,927
Cathy Morgan Foreman,
who is Cathy Morgan Foreman?

96
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,717
Cathy works in...

97
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:05,157
Cathy works
in the department of Shulupust.

98
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:08,137
– Department of what?
– Oh excuse me, that's my phone ringing.

99
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,357
– I didn't hear anything?
– It's on vibrate.

100
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:11,457
Hello?

101
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:12,757
Hello, Cathy!

102
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,927
Yes, you parcel did arrive,
I'm keeping it here safe for you.

103
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,027
No problem at all Cathy Morgan Foreman.

104
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,417
If he comes by...

105
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:21,757
Right. If who comes by?

106
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:24,457
The News.

107
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,527
Yes, right?

108
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,717
If he calls,

109
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,927
just tell him something.

110
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,087
– Leave it with me!
– Great!

111
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:32,457
Although I should just say
I'm not very good at lying.

112
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,747
I'm very good at lying.

113
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,507
I thought you were on the phone!

114
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,357
Yeah, I am.

115
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,277
Yes, that's fine.

116
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:43,837
Hello?

117
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:47,397
Listen Moss,
you're not going to Court, yeah?

118
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,267
Just tell him something.

119
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:52,177
It's just... I've never been very good
at judging the scale

120
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,357
– of the lie...
– Yes, stop over thinking everything.

121
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:57,277
– I couldn’t do it when I was a child,
– You're getting yourself in a tease,

122
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:58,337
I told a whopper and...

123
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,607
Just tell him I'm busy!

124
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,697
You're busy!

125
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,857
That's brilliant!

126
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,877
Just don't let him in here
under any circumstances.

127
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,247
No!

128
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,367
You're busy!

129
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,417
Hey, um, what was the name of that girl,

130
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:19,957
that Jen knows, was it Julie or Judy?

131
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,597
Yes, one of those.

132
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,707
Okay, I'm just going to go
for a letch on fifth.

133
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:30,867
Yes.

134
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,397
Look! I told you she's busy!

135
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,927
Hey, back off, bastard!
This lady's busy!

136
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,697
Too busy for you.

137
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,217
Busy!

138
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,507
Brilliant!

139
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,377
– Hello?
– Hello!

140
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,427
I'm just looking for Jen.

141
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:18,047
I'm afraid Jen can't see you
at the moment.

142
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,497
She's very busy.

143
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,917
– Is she?
– She's a busy Miss Lizzy!

144
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:23,297
Good bye!

145
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:27,647
What is she doing?

146
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,947
She's doing fine.

147
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:31,787
Not how is she doing, what is she doing?

148
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,347
– Is she in here?
– No.

149
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,087
I won't keep her,
I want to give her these.

150
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,637
– Don't give her.
– I'll give her these.

151
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,207
– She won't like them.
– She won't mind!

152
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:40,847
She will mind.

153
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:42,597
It's not a problem.
I won't take any time.

154
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,837
Look, why can't I go in?

155
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,237
Because she's dead!

156
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,807
What?

157
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,567
Yeah, she's dead. She... she died.

158
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:57,117
She died last night.

159
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:00,147
She died?!

160
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,307
Yeah!

161
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:02,487
Completely.

162
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:05,797
Oh God!

163
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,057
Fuck!

164
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,487
I just can't believe it!

165
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,647
Well, I'd hardly make up
something like that, would I?

166
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,477
No, no of course, of course not.

167
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,487
Oh God!

168
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,447
Well, she was a bit off
at the restaurant.

169
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:24,177
I mean...

170
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:25,557
Was it the food?

171
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,467
– The tapas, do they know?
– Teipas!

172
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:28,847
I don't know.

173
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:31,087
Yes it was, why not.

174
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:34,967
Oh Jesus!

175
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:37,217
I know it's terrible, but,

176
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,957
thank God, we weren't sharing.

177
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,417
I just can't get over it.

178
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,577
Yeah, well,

179
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,687
we all have to go sometime.

180
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,067
It's terrible, it's just terrible!

181
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:53,927
It's bloody awful!

182
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,047
She was so beautiful!

183
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,417
She was some piece of ass.

184
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:08,117
Anyhow, can't mourn
all the ruddy day, so...

185
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,107
You know...

186
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,247
I was the last person to sleep with her.

187
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,747
– Really? She said that...
– What?

188
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:29,387
She said she was looking forward to sleeping with you.

189
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,787
I can't believe he lied like that.

190
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:57,307
Doesn't he realise that lying
can lead to very serious ramifications?

191
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,027
Hello?

192
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,417
Hello!

193
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:14,057
I'm Roy!

194
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:15,727
I.T.

195
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:20,367
My boss has assigned me to any work
you might want done...

196
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,407
personally.

197
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,027
personal... personally.

198
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,577
Basically, if you want to

199
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,287
just take my card.

200
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:32,937
And...

201
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:35,837
if you need anything done

202
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,597
to your computer,

203
00:09:37,697 --> 00:09:42,237
just give me a buzz, on me phone.
It's my mobile phone, so

204
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:45,427
you won't have to go through
all that call waiting...

205
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:46,557
Lover.

206
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,217
Okay, thank you, Roy.

207
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,037
You're welcome, Judy.

208
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,417
Oh, I'm not Judy, I'm Julie.

209
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:53,847
Judy?

210
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,917
Someone to see you!

211
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,197
This man says you should take his card.

212
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,767
The girl from I.T., that's terrible.

213
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,897
I know, terrible, terrible thing.

214
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,507
You know, I was actually the last person
to sleep with her.

215
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,427
Very sudden, yes.

216
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,377
I heard it was some bad tapas.

217
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:17,477
Teipas.

218
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,507
Yes.

219
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:19,757
You must be stunned.

220
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,077
I'm flabbergasted

221
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,237
Well, you know where we are
if you need us.

222
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:25,417
Sure, I'll be fine, thanks.

223
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,737
Just sort of stay away
from this whole area,

224
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,407
while we come to terms with the loss.

225
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,077
Leave me now, I would be alone.

226
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,707
Good lech?

227
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:55,407
No!

228
00:10:55,527 --> 00:11:00,877
The girl, oh my God,
the girl, Judy, she's a...

229
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,887
– Have you seen this girl?
– What's she like?

230
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:07,147
– Well, she has hair on her eyes.
– Who has hair on her eyes?

231
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:08,637
– Not you.
– No.

232
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,497
I'm going for a coffee,
anyone wants anything?

233
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,207
No? Okay, bye!

234
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:37,417
– Hello?
– Hello?

235
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:40,727
Hello Judy?

236
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,777
What can I do for you?

237
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:44,227
Computer is broken!

238
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,437
Is it a PC or a Mac?

239
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,407
Yes!

240
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:51,557
Well, what's wrong with it?

241
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:52,917
Broken down!

242
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:55,187
Yeah, broken down how, Judy?

243
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,677
– Big bang noise!
– Big bang noise, what...

244
00:11:57,887 --> 00:11:59,937
What's the precise nature
of the problem?

245
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,447
MIO

246
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,367
Judy, the battery of my phone is...

247
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,317
– Look at this.
– What?

248
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,097
How nice is this?

249
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:18,867
I just got a big load of flowers,

250
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,577
and a big card!

251
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,327
And everyone has signed it!

252
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,137
"You will always be in our heart!"

253
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,547
My God! And you said
they weren't nice here!

254
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:30,847
Yeah.

255
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,757
I don't understand
why they've done this?

256
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,287
Why?

257
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:37,757
I'll tell for why.

258
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,347
It's because everyone thinks
you're brilliant!

259
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:42,727
– Really?
– Yeah!

260
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,067
And in fact, everyone thinks
you're so brilliant,

261
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,647
they've just made you
Employee of the Month.

262
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:48,897
– No?
– Yes!

263
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:49,947
– No?
– Yes!

264
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,147
– No!
– Yaha!

265
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:52,927
I don't believe it!

266
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,487
– Please believe it.
– Oh my God!

267
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,967
I didn't even know they had
Employee of the Month here.

268
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,287
No, they brought it in just for you.

269
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,407
I'm gonna go up
and thank everybody right now.

270
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,487
No! Don't do that!

271
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:09,967
What? Why not?

272
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,057
They'll be embarrassed.

273
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,747
It's embarrassing being thanked.

274
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:17,297
Don't be silly.

275
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,757
Events seem to be taking
a downward turn.

276
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,057
I told you, stop calling me at work!

277
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:43,197
Nice and beautiful Jen!

278
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,007
Hello, Small Pall!

279
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,097
Didn't... Are you...
I thought you were sick or something.

280
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:49,727
Sick? Me? No!

281
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,527
I couldn't be better, I've just won
Employee of the Month.

282
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:55,337
So, um, you're going my way?

283
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,447
Don't you dare going too fast, no!

284
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,777
Just...

285
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,057
hard to get your head round, you know?

286
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:14,667
One minute, she's there and

287
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,637
next minute...

288
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:18,017
just gone.

289
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:19,347
You know,

290
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,147
I was the last person
that slept with her actually.

291
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:26,937
She held on so tightly,
you know, it was like...

292
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,687
scary, but,

293
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:32,557
sexy scary, you know, just like...

294
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:42,657
Jen?!

295
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:44,497
It was her!

296
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:49,207
What are you still doing here Bill,
for God sake, go home!

297
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,957
He was the last person
to sleep with her.

298
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,227
I know... Apparently, she was
pretty hard stuff!

299
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,717
Bye, Small Paul!

300
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,947
Bye Jen, see you.

301
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,017
Oh dear, oh Lord!

302
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,907
At this dreadful hour

303
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:15,277
we're all reminded how brief
our time is here on Earth.

304
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,917
Sorry, who is it who died?

305
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,227
I don't know.

306
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,397
I believe Mr. Renholm has a few words.

307
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,047
There's one more angel in Heaven.

308
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:32,517
God, I miss Jen!

309
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:35,937
She reminded me of me, at her age.

310
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,727
I mean, when I was her age,

311
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:42,087
she reminded me of her age.

312
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:47,357
She reminded me of my age at her age.

313
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:51,997
When I was her age,

314
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,107
she was reminded of me?

315
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,627
I truly liked Jen.

316
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:03,387
And that en-likening of her
became a friendship.

317
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,037
A friendship which ended so suddenly,

318
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:08,127
just twelve hours ago...

319
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:13,207
After... what I gather, was a rather
sensational evening with Bill Crouse!

320
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,067
Bill, you dog!

321
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,607
Where is he?

322
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,167
Still cleaning himself off.

323
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,037
She was special.

324
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:24,517
So special in fact,

325
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:27,467
that when I called
my close personal friend

326
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,287
Elton John and told him about her,

327
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:32,067
he dropped everything,

328
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,737
and offered to come here
and perform for us!

329
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,837
You heard me, he's in the building!

330
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:39,847
Elton John is going to sing
a beautiful song

331
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:41,197
about death.

332
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,877
Oh my God, this is so...

333
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:57,657
so lovely

334
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,607
Thank you, so, so much!

335
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:04,177
Tank you, thank you, oh God!

336
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:15,417
Could I, say a few words?

337
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,907
Oh my God!

338
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,717
Thank you, so, so much!

339
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,567
I would...

340
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:26,747
I would not be standing up here today

341
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:30,157
if it wasn't for so many things
but, not least,

342
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,847
– Without him...
– Hey, she isn't dead!

343
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,127
Yeah!

344
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:39,277
You lying cow!

345
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:42,727
We want Elton!

346
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:47,697
We want Elton! We want Elton!
We want Elton!

347
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,557
Okay!

348
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:54,077
If that Judy woman comes down,
I don't work here,

349
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,957
you've never seen me,
just make up something,

350
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:56,797
just get rid of her!

351
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:59,117
She's easy to spot,
she's has three rows of teeth.

352
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,697
Listen, if I needed to get out of
the country, very, very cheaply,

353
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,647
how would I go about doing that?

354
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,117
Hey you!

355
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,257
What did you say about me?

356
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:14,747
Hello there, Jen!

357
00:18:15,037 --> 00:18:16,677
I would love to stay and chat,

358
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,857
but, I've just received
a telephone call,

359
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:21,377
saying that my father
has just killed someone.

360
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,677
I need to attend to.

361
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:26,707
Did you tell everyone I was dead?

362
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:34,787
Maybe?

363
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,477
Because, um,

364
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,967
they all thought I was dead.

365
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,467
– I know something.
– What? What do you know?

366
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:49,047
Bill Crouse, he's saying
he slept with you last night.

367
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:50,117
He's saying what?

368
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:51,057
He think you're dead,

369
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:52,967
so he's telling everybody
you slept with him.

370
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,517
He's the one you should be angry at!

371
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,697
Not me! I'm insignificant!

372
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,227
Bastard!

373
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:06,167
Voicemail!

374
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,577
Hey!

375
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,087
It's Jen!

376
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:13,427
Stop telling everyone I slept with you!

377
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,047
You bastard!

378
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,697
Must have gone home.

379
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:21,657
Oh God, my throat hurts.

380
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:26,007
Well, it's probably all that shouting.

381
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,447
I'm talking, aren't I?

382
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,887
Can you get me his address?

383
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,857
Yes, it might be a bit difficult.

384
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,127
I have to hack into
his private company account,

385
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:39,257
it might take some time.

386
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:41,337
There we go.

387
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,697
Oh, I really don't feel very well.

388
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,937
Well, you look terrible.

389
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:53,707
I'm still talking, aren't I?

390
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:04,837
You have one new message.

391
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:06,077
Hey!

392
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:07,407
It's Jen!

393
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,267
Stop telling people I slept with you!

394
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,157
You bastard!

395
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,817
Where Roy?

396
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,887
Roy is dead!

397
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:44,327
No, no! Don't breakdown!

398
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,357
Don't break down, you bitch!

399
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:52,967
Oh my God, oh my God!

400
00:20:55,907 --> 00:20:57,337
Bloody hell!

401
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:04,047
Why you do that to me
when I need this chance?

402
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,377
Oh for God's sake!
Now my car is bloody open

403
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:08,037
and I don't know what it means!

404
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:16,007
Come on, come on Ritchley...
Street, Ritchley Street.

405
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,147
My God, okay, I'm... Right.

406
00:21:25,697 --> 00:21:27,547
Probably guys, probably guys,

407
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:29,637
leaving message, funny message,

408
00:21:29,777 --> 00:21:33,777
probably, Bob,
it's Bob leaving funny messages.

409
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:36,417
And the, the floating head.

410
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,157
It's all stress,

411
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,937
a bit stress is all and...
just fun and games.

412
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:53,297
Oh God!

413
00:21:59,077 --> 00:22:00,857
Oh God!

414
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:04,357
Let me in! Let me in Bill!

415
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,247
No!

416
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,577
It's raining! Please, let me in!

417
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,427
No, you're never coming in!

418
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:13,947
Stop telling people I slept with you!

419
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,997
I will! I will! I'm sorry!

420
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,477
Bastard!

421
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,717
You bastard!

422
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:23,087
Oh no! I'm sorry!

423
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:25,747
You bastard!

424
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:46,437
Small Paul, you're gone now.

425
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:50,537
You pushed that trolley
a little too hard,

426
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:55,867
You felt a twinge,
it was your heart and you're dead now...

427
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,767
And now you're running four feet
in heaven...

428
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,727
– Did you know him?
– No.

429
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,727
I don't think that's Elton John.
