1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,484
Wow! That's quite something.
Quite an honour.

2
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:35,996
— I know.
— They must be very impressed with you.

3
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:39,278
I didn't even know they had
an Employee of the Month thing here.

4
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,877
— Really? I thought you won it once.
— No, everyone thought I was dead.

5
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:44,235
Aha.

6
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:47,518
Employee... of the Month.

7
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,958
Yeah, it's a valued title.

8
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:53,284
— Have you ever won it?
— Er, no. No, I haven't.

9
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:55,427
I don't know, Jen,
sometimes I think

10
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,878
it's because I just
want it so damn much!

11
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:00,723
I am the Employee of the Month.

12
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:02,870
And yet, to a casual
observer, it would

13
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,238
appear that you do
very little around here.

14
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:08,325
Yeah. They must have seen through that.

15
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:12,884
I think someone up there
must have sensed something in me,

16
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:17,922
something I've always known
was there — a greatness?

17
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:22,245
No, I'm not saying that,
but... well, something.

18
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah! Yeah, I'm sensing something.

19
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:28,886
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

20
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,043
Guess who's won
Employee of the Month.

21
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,397
— Roy.
— No.

22
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,846
— Richmond.
— No.

23
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,366
— Harry.
— Who's Harry?

24
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,239
— The postman.
— No.

25
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,039
— Me.
— No.

26
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,601
— I said Roy, right? Richmond.
— Meeeee!

27
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,116
— Oh! Oh, about time!
— Yeah.

28
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:51,726
— Whatever happened to Richmond?
— He got scurvy.

29
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,510
Be more specific.
I'm trying to build up

30
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,956
a picture of your role
in Reynholm Industries.

31
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, I'm the boss,
head honcho, el numero uno,

32
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,436
Mr Big, the Godfather,

33
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,637
Lord of the Rings,

34
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,723
the Bourne Identity,

35
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,680
er... Taxi Driver,

36
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,559
Jaws.

37
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,838
I forgot the question quite
a while back. Who are you again?

38
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:22,846
I'm April Shepherd. You're being made
Richest magazine's Man of the Year.

39
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:25,356
— I'm doing the profile.
— Oh, yes, that's right.

40
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:27,731
You're the boss —
what does that entail?

41
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:28,957
Oh, many things.

42
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,446
This morning,
for instance, I had to choose

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,717
the Employee
of the Month from the box.

44
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,722
May I ask,
what are you doing on that pad?

45
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:42,840
One of my little hobbies
is caricature.

46
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:46,437
Sometimes I like to sketch someone
as I'm talking to them.

47
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,876
— May I?
— Well, I'm not very good.

48
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,646
I'm no Truman Capote.

49
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:02,442
Great. OK, erm... I'll tell you what,
let's just do some quickfire questions.

50
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,445
Maybe they'll give me an insight
into «the real you.»

51
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,556
OK.

52
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,180
Who is your favourite
person from history?

53
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,475
Sherlock Holmes.

54
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:14,962
— Well, he's fictional.
— Whoa!

55
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:18,363
I think you'd better
check your facts there. Fictional?

56
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,352
Who took care
of the business with

57
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,241
the giant dog that was
eating everybody?

58
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,846
It wasn't Watson.

59
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't tell me,
I suppose he was fictional too?

60
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,918
Maybe there was no giant dog.

61
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:35,556
No, no, I think you're playing games
with me, young lady!

62
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:39,237
OK, then, favourite
fictional character?

63
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,203
Oh... the Elephant Man.

64
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,415
Tell you what, let me
widen the question out.

65
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,762
Favourite popular figure?

66
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,765
— Churchill.
— What is it you like about him?

67
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,878
I love the way he says:

68
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:54,363
«Oh, yes! Oh, yes!»

69
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:59,402
I think perhaps it's you
who's playing games with me.

70
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,544
You're a very surprising
man, Mr Reynholm.

71
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:03,566
Yes...

72
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,677
I am a surprising man.

73
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,126
April, may I take you to dinner?

74
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:13,759
— Oh, I don't think I could possibly...
— In Paris.

75
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,723
— Paris?!
— Paris, yes.

76
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,803
It's the name
of a new restaurant in Hull.

77
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,236
That's right, we're going to Hull!

78
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,239
Hey, Roy, come over here.
Look at this.

79
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:31,673
«The biggest adventure
you can ever take

80
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,963
is to live the life
of your dreams» —

81
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,237
Oprah Winfrey»?!

82
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,200
I suppose that is the biggest adventure.

83
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,602
Guys, come on in.

84
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:44,399
Sit down.

85
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:46,483
— Is this a new desk?
— Yeah.

86
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,831
I thought I needed
some new furniture, so

87
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,078
I got some stuff from
upstairs. Sit down.

88
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,445
I just thought, what with

89
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:02,482
all this extra attention
on us... on me,

90
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,934
it might be worth
looking at ourselves and

91
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,285
saying, «Hey, am I
really giving it 110%?»

92
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,680
«And if not, why not?
What the heck is wrong

93
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,923
with me? Am I mentally
ill or something?»

94
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,641
Roy, let's start with you.

95
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:21,520
When you're upstairs,
fiddling about with compu-ters,

96
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:24,559
would it hurt to smile?

97
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:28,202
Don't you realise
what a difference that would make? Eh?

98
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:31,080
Come on, let's see a smile now.
Come on.

99
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,323
No, more warmth. Warmer.

100
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:40,760
You're just showing more teeth.
That's not warmth.

101
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,845
I would say that's
more of a threatening look, actually.

102
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:47,721
I'll tell you what, Roy, keep at it.
That's your homework. Moss...

103
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,358
So, what's your
speech going to be about?

104
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,442
What speech?

105
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,332
Every Employee
of the Month has to give

106
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:55,606
a speech in
their area of expertise.

107
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:58,287
Which for you is «compu-ters».

108
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:06,086
— Where do I have to...?
— At the monthly shareholders' meeting.

109
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:09,123
— When do I have to...?
— Friday.

110
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,404
— What time...?
— Morning.

111
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,845
How's that?

112
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:45,517
— What's up, guys?
— All right, Jen?

113
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,438
Ohhhhh... God!

114
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:53,561
— Just writing a speech.
— Oh, yeah, that's right.

115
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:58,158
— How's that going?
— Good, good, good, good, good, good.

116
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,642
You know, I was thinking...

117
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,792
if there's anything
you guys want

118
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,840
I can put it in,
it's no problem.

119
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh! Oh, yeah.
Hm, interesting.

120
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,996
Erm, is there anything you'd like to say
to the shareholders, Moss?

121
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,119
— Just say hi.
— Say hi from us.

122
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:20,486
— OK.
— I love this.

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,723
How many more times
is she going to come in?

124
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:25,964
Maybe it'd be a good idea
if you two contributed to this.

125
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,043
Oh, yeah? Why?

126
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:32,843
I think it would give you experience
in writing a speech for a public figure.

127
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, obviously,
in our line of work that would be handy.

128
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:40,159
But you know what, Jen?
I'm actually snowed under here.

129
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,917
Wait a second. Wait a second!

130
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,515
— Oh! Oh, what are we doing?!
— Huh?

131
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,956
— We should totally write that speech!
— Why?

132
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,317
— OK, offer to write the speech for Jen.
— No.

133
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,722
She'll know something's up if I do it.

134
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:59,883
— You have to do it.
— Why would I do that?

135
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,362
— Moss, do you trust me?
— No.

136
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,998
— Do you trust me?
— No.

137
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:07,561
If you trust me,
then offer to write that speech.

138
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,723
I. Don't. Trust. You.

139
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,883
Hello?

140
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,363
I feel really bad,
having all the fun writing this speech.

141
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,523
Do it.
Offer, offer, offer.

142
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,798
Well, I suppose
we could write the speech

143
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:24,397
so that, you know, you look like
you know what you're talking about.

144
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,963
Thanks. I'm off for lunch.
Leave it on my desk.

145
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,363
My God!

146
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,000
I know.

147
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,685
That's brilliant!

148
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,117
So now you understand why
we have to write that speech for Jen.

149
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,602
She will say anything we tell her to.

150
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,717
She will say anything we tell her to.

151
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,111
We can put any
old bollocks in that

152
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,398
speech, and she shall repeat it.

153
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,041
It's going to be hilarious.

154
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,079
Sometimes I could kiss your mind, Roy!

155
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:59,676
OK, so let's just... I don't know,
let's just throw around a few ideas.

156
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,082
— OK, let's do it.
— OK.

157
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:07,804
Ooh! Could we tell her that there's
an apple inside every Apple Mac?

158
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,923
— It's good.
— Yeah.

159
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,140
We could say that
Bill Gates is called

160
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,598
Bill Gates because
he owns a lot of gates.

161
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,878
Hm! That's good.
It's not quite punchy enough.

162
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:25,161
And it's probably true now anyway —
I'll bet he does own a lot of gates.

163
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:27,847
He probably does.

164
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:34,205
It's got to be something big.

165
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,887
I think I may have it.

166
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,645
What?

167
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,997
You best put seatbelts
on your ears, Roy,

168
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:44,642
cos I'm going to take them
for the ride of their lives.

169
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:00,016
— Delightful.
— Oh, no, no, no. You're silly.

170
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:04,777
Do you know, I've never been
so enchanted by a woman in all my life.

171
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:08,058
What's your name again?
I know you told me.

172
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,587
— April.
— Ah, what a charming name.

173
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:14,346
Always been one of my favourites.

174
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:20,542
April... after dinner, would you do me
the honour of accompanying me to my bed?

175
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,659
— Oh. Erm...
— No, I've said too much!

176
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:29,700
I've let my heart overpower my head,
which is my wont.

177
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,817
But I don't care.
I find you enchanting.

178
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:39,583
And there's a condom machine
in the toilet — I've checked.

179
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,848
I'm very flattered,
Douglas, but, erm...

180
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,264
there's a problem,
something I should tell you.

181
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:51,459
— Go on.
— Erm...

182
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,737
I have a secret.

183
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,772
I could dance around
the subject, but I

184
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,701
like you, I want to
be straight with you.

185
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,624
Oh?

186
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,738
Erm...

187
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,222
I used to be a man, Douglas.

188
00:11:05,507 --> 00:11:07,099
I used to be a man.

189
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,344
I wish there was
an easier way of saying

190
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,266
that, but believe
me, there's not.

191
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:16,017
I've had a lot of hormone therapy
and a number of operations.

192
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:17,262
I'm really sorry.

193
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:20,060
I... I hope you don't
feel I deceived you.

194
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:22,781
I understand if you would rather I left.

195
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,785
I don't care.

196
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,059
What?!

197
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,143
Doesn't bother me.

198
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,497
Doesn't bother you at all?

199
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,902
It takes all sorts to make a world.

200
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,142
Wow!

201
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,622
— It bothers most men.
— I'm not most men.

202
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:44,307
And the offer still stands.

203
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:47,180
Are you up for it?

204
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:55,223
Oh!

205
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,464
Amazing! Just amazing.

206
00:11:58,587 --> 00:11:59,753
You liked it?

207
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:03,297
You really know your
way around that area.

208
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:05,906
Well...

209
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:09,019
Tell me, what are you doing
tomorrow night, April?

210
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:12,025
I was thinking of staying in
and watching the darts.

211
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:14,707
You've read my mind.

212
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,703
What is it?

213
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:06,137
This, Jen... is the internet.

214
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,503
— What?
— That's right.

215
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,583
This is the internet?

216
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:23,064
— The whole internet?
— Yep.

217
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:26,975
I asked for a loan of it
so that you could use it in your speech.

218
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:28,984
It's so small!

219
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,383
That's one of the
surprising things about it.

220
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:36,025
Hang on, it doesn't have
any wires or anything.

221
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:38,297
It's wireless.

222
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:41,021
Oh, yes, everything's wireless
nowadays, isn't it?

223
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,945
I can really use it in my speech?
What if someone needs it?

224
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,218
People will still be able to go online.
It will still work.

225
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,019
Oh, good.

226
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:51,804
I tell you, you
present this to the

227
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:54,906
shareholders and you
will get quite a response.

228
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:57,383
Can I touch it?

229
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:02,739
Oh! It's so light!

230
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:05,665
Of course it is.
The internet doesn't weigh anything.

231
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:08,620
No, of course it doesn't.

232
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,144
Hey!

233
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,304
What is Jen doing with the internet?!

234
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,083
Moss said I could use it for my speech.

235
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,059
Are you insane?!

236
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,224
— What if she drops it?
— I won't drop it. I'll look after it.

237
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:23,826
No! No, no, no, no, no, Jen.

238
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,020
No, this... this needs to go
straight back to Big Ben.

239
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,184
— Big Ben?
— Yep, it goes on top of Big Ben.

240
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,616
That's where you get the best reception.

241
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,094
I promise I won't let
anything happen to it.

242
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,422
No, Jen, I'm sorry.

243
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:40,903
The elders of the internet
would never stand for it.

244
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,614
No, Roy, I spoke to the elders

245
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:44,224
of the internet
not one hour ago.

246
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:46,815
I told them about Jen winning
Employee of the Month.

247
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:50,940
They were so impressed that they wanted
to do whatever they could to help.

248
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:55,780
Wait a minute!
The elders of the internet?

249
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,998
The elders of the

250
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,102
internet know who I am?!

251
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:02,661
You've got to let me have it!

252
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:04,903
No, Jen.
I'm sorry, it's just too risky.

253
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,257
— Oh, please, Roy?
— Oh...

254
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:12,063
Well... Moss, has it been
completely demagnetised?

255
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:15,585
By Stephen Hawking himself.

256
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:19,143
Who sends his congratulations,
by the way.

257
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,464
Well, if it's OK with the Hawk...

258
00:15:23,307 --> 00:15:25,263
So can I have it?

259
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:27,343
You can.

260
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,896
— Oh, don't forget your speech.
— Thank you.

261
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:40,666
— Shh!
— Shh!

262
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,503
Slowly.

263
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:58,378
April, these past few days
have been like a dream.

264
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:03,824
Usually, I can't wait to get away
from a woman once I've ejaculated.

265
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:09,705
But with you...
I don't know, I feel alive.

266
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:14,422
— April, I love you.
— What?!

267
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:18,017
That's right.
I totally love the bloody arse off you.

268
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:21,902
Oh, Douglas, I love you too!

269
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:25,573
Oh, poppet... to think
when we met you

270
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:28,583
were so worried that
you came from Iran.

271
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:39,455
— What?
— When we met.

272
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,942
As if I'd be worried
about something like that.

273
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,706
I don't care where you're from —
Iran, France...

274
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:47,580
Doesn't bother me.
I'm very modern.

275
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,346
I'm not from Iran.

276
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,856
Well, you said
something along those lines.

277
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:57,265
No, not «Iran», «a man».
I said, «I used to be a man.»

278
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,737
You used to be a man?!

279
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:04,624
Yes!

280
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,623
Oh, God!

281
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:46,057
Well, we have a very interesting talk
lined up for today.

282
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:50,021
Our Employee of the Month
and computer expert Jen Barber

283
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:54,220
has kindly agreed to say a few words
about her role in the IT department.

284
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,062
Speaking as someone
who doesn't know the difference

285
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:01,544
between a laptop and, erm...
the larger one,

286
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,818
I'm certainly looking forward
to hearing what she has to say.

287
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:17,536
Good morning.

288
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:23,139
When I was asked to give a speech
about what it is I do and everything...

289
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,904
I was very excited.

290
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:27,983
«At last,» I thought,

291
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,332
«a chance to explain
the wonders of

292
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:34,580
technology to...
ordinary folk.»

293
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:39,013
But then I thought,
«Who wants to listen

294
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:42,142
to a boring old speech?»

295
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,713
Wouldn't it be better
if I could actually

296
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:49,182
bring one of these
wonders in to show you?

297
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:53,346
Say, I don't know... the internet.

298
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,697
I think it would, and I have.

299
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:58,113
Ladies and
gentlemen,

300
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,423
I'd like to present to you...
the internet!

301
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:06,541
Oh, please, no flash photography.
You'll harm the internet.

302
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,587
— Ladies and gentlemen...
— Why is no one laughing?

303
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:12,868
... if anything were

304
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:14,301
to happen to this box,

305
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:18,579
the world as we know it
would fall into chaos,

306
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,112
planes would drop from

307
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:21,540
the sky like tables,

308
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:26,695
society would tear itself apart
like an angry child with a napkin.

309
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,962
Man's primeval
instinct to survive at

310
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:32,945
any cost would lead
to terrible violence.

311
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,098
So, please, no flash photography.

312
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:43,777
I must say,
this is all very impressive, Douglas.

313
00:19:43,907 --> 00:19:46,944
— So what exactly are you working on?
— I don't know.

314
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,976
April... we need to talk.

315
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,337
Oh, darling,
couldn't we do this at home?

316
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:56,459
I was hoping we could get shitfaced
and watch the telly.

317
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:59,818
There'll no more getting shitfaced
and watching the telly,

318
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:02,780
there'll be no more
Steven Seagal marathons,

319
00:20:02,907 --> 00:20:05,626
and there'll be no more
paintballing weekends.

320
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,706
I'm afraid our adventure
has come to an end.

321
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:13,820
— What?! But... but why?
— It's not you, it's me.

322
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,983
No, actually,
it's not me, it is you.

323
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,984
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:20,053
You don't think of me
as a woman, do you?

325
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,338
What? Of course I do.

326
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:23,998
It bothers you that
I used to be a man!

327
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:24,857
No!

328
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,138
I love that you used to be a man —
it's your thing.

329
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,986
I love thinking about
that operation that you had.

330
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,339
Oh, please!
Look at me — I am a woman.

331
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,016
— This is a woman in front of you!
— Excuse me.

332
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:41,263
I am a woman!

333
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:47,701
— You're tearing me apart.
— Please, Douglas.

334
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,176
I'm sorry, it's beyond my control.

335
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:53,980
Please, Douglas. Please!

336
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:57,656
Just go.
You're making this harder for me.

337
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,386
You...!

338
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,782
How could you do this?

339
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:05,546
How could you do this to me?!

340
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,223
You bastard!

341
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,986
... and that's what
the flashing light is for.

342
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:09,063
— Any more?
— Is it heavy?

343
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:11,600
Is it... That's a bit
of a silly question —

344
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,977
the internet doesn't
weigh anything.

345
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:18,938
Well, OK, guys,
I guess I should wrap it up.

346
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:22,184
— Aw...
— No, no, I really have to finish up.

347
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,060
More! More! More!
More! More! More!

348
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:29,182
Guys!
Oh, my God, you really like me.

349
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:32,140
— This really isn't that funny.
— I know. It's terrible.

350
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:36,306
I thought at least we'd get a good story
out of it, something we'd remember.

351
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:44,422
It's over, April!

352
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:48,823
Jesus!

353
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,142
The internet!

354
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:55,106
We're all going to die!

355
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:03,381
Everybody stay calm.

356
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:16,416
Wait for me! Wait!

357
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:33,059
He needs to hold his nerve now.

358
00:23:36,787 --> 00:23:39,665
He's done it!

359
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:42,176
But it's not the same!

360
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,663
Oh, April!

361
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:51,687
