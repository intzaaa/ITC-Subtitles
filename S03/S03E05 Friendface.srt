1
00:00:00,887 --> 00:00:02,707
What is Friendface?

2
00:00:02,787 --> 00:00:05,707
Friendface is a great new
site for meeting people.

3
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:06,707
How does it work?

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:10,907
Friendface works along the same
principle as a cold or a plague,

5
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:14,587
but it's not disgusting germs that
Friendface spreads, it's friendship.

6
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:18,867
Each Friendface page is like a petri
dish filled with friendship germs.

7
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,907
When you stick your face into the
dish, you may come away with millions

8
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:24,067
of people attached to your face!

9
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,547
That's right, it's basically
a diseased face of friendship!

10
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:30,787
Just sign up with Friendface,
by giving us all of your personal information,

11
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:33,947
and we'll provide a
web page where you can meet new

12
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:37,907
friends, catch up with old ones,
and maybe find that special someone.

13
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:41,147
Don't think about germs now,
that analogy's over.

14
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,387
Now it's just love and companionship,
and everything's fine.

15
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:47,367
We own everything
you put on Friendface,

16
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,907
it says so in the terms
and agreements, but don't worry about that,

17
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:52,347
we won't use it to do anything bad,
we promise.

18
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:56,027
Just think about love and
companionship and everything's fine.

19
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,887
Can you two not use my email address any more please,

20
00:01:32,887 --> 00:01:33,787
I've got a new one.

21
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:34,787
Right.

22
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:37,587
Jennywenny@Friendface?

23
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:38,987
Oh, no, you've not signed
up with Friendface have you?

24
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:41,267
Yes, I have, actually.
Why not, it's great.

25
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,147
I joined last night, and
I've already got 30 friends.

26
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:47,467
Baaaaaaa!
Yes, let's all join Friendface

27
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,507
and become part of the herd. Ha!
I don't think so.

28
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:52,827
Why not?
They're terrific!

29
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:56,147
You can catch up on old friends,
you can flirt with people.

30
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:58,627
I think I've got better things
to do than to talk to friends

31
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,387
and flirt with people, thank you.

32
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,227
You can play Scrabble online with it.

33
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:06,027
It's just another way of shoving

34
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:08,547
advertising in your face, Jen.
Don't do it, you'll regret it.

35
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:12,427
It might be a great way to meet
women. All the girls on 7 are on it.

36
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,107
I'm in.

37
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,347
What?

38
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:15,507
I've joined.

39
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:16,667
That was quick!

40
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:20,067
It was what you said about Scrabble.
I'm in a game now.

41
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:20,747
I'm in!

42
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:21,467
What?

43
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:21,947
I've joined!

44
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,267
What about the advertising?

45
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:26,427
Oh, advertising doesn't have any
effect on me, Jen.

46
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,827
I tune it out. So, er, the girls on
7, Kimberley, she's on this?

47
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:29,867
Uh huh.

48
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:34,027
Ah, cool, look! They've got this
great game on their home page.

49
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,667
You have to throw a little
can of cola into a giant mouth.

50
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:38,307
That's brilliant.

51
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:40,227
God, I'm so thirsty.

52
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,907
Listen, I've got to have a
word with you, oh, hang on.

53
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:05,067
Jen, you can change your
setting on Friendface

54
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,827
so you don't have to have that
annoying bleep

55
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,067
every time you get a message.

56
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,027
Incoming message!

57
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,427
Sorry, that's me.

58
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,867
Yeah, I just have to tell
you about, oh, hang on.

59
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:19,707
Yep, Jen, just open a chat window
and then we can all talk in it.

60
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:20,627
How do I do that?

61
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,827
You just press the speech
bubble in the left hand corner.

62
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,147
Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,747
Yes.

64
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:38,147
Oh, yeah, but don't forget if...

65
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:41,667
What are you like?

66
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:42,827
If I might interject.

67
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,347
Oh, Moss.

68
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:50,067
That's hilarious.

69
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,107
That was a classic Moss line.

70
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:57,627
Yeah.

71
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:04,347
I love this.

72
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,307
I feel so social.

73
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,227
All right Jen I'm going to go
home now, it's nearly half seven.

74
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:15,707
I'm just answering all my Friendface
messages, they sort of piled up.

75
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:19,227
So many people I don't care about
getting in touch, it's brilliant.

76
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,667
Oh, there's another one,

77
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,227
and I'm getting into online games,
you know, real brain teasers.

78
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:28,067
And I'm filling out a form on how
much I love Cuke, have you tried it?

79
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,987
Cuke, yeah,
I love Cuke, it's heaven in a can.

80
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:39,227
Anyway I'm going to head, all right.
Jen, don't get too obsessed by that.

81
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:41,267
No, I won't.
Bye, Moss.

82
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:49,747
Oh,
someone's added me as their friend,

83
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,547
I went to school with her,
I wonder how she's doing?

84
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,907
Oh, not very well. That's good.

85
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,867
Incoming message.

86
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,427
Jesus Christ!

87
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,187
I mean, Jesus Christ.

88
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:22,227
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

89
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:24,547
Excuse me, some of us are
trying to sleep round here.

90
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:28,467
This woman that I went out with
once wants to meet up again.

91
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,987
Oh, I thought I got rid of her, but
oh, no, she found me on Friendface.

92
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,747
Now I'm going to have to
spend all afternoon

93
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,667
trying to make up lies of how
to get rid of her again.

94
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,067
Oh, I think that is very mean,

95
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,107
if it were me I would
like to know the truth.

96
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,627
That you wear
way too much makeup.

97
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:44,627
I do not!

98
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:48,587
That's a horrible
thing to say, how dare you.

99
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,387
Not you Jen, this girl.

100
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,187
Oh, does she?

101
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,267
Big time.

102
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:54,987
Did you sleep with her?

103
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,147
No.

104
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:00,027
It wasn't my fault,
I got really drunk to try and

105
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,867
make the evening pass quicker,
and then by the end of it

106
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,987
the makeup thing was actually
starting to work for me a bit.

107
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,347
Oh, please.

108
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,587
I'm not proud of it Jen,
it's not going on my CV,

109
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,867
but every man has a story like this.

110
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,667
This is not the first story
you've told me like this.

111
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,027
Every man has a few stories
like this.

112
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,867
Oh, no!

113
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,147
She used to
slap it on with a trowel.

114
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:23,627
God, why don't women have the
confidence to know that less is more.

115
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,947
Then, when she started crying

116
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:30,107
it all ran down her face, it
was like breaking up with The Joker.

117
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:34,547
Hang on, she was,
she was that upset, she was crying?

118
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:37,587
It sounds like you really
hurt this girl's feelings.

119
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:41,347
The least you can do is tell the
truth, be a man for God's sake.

120
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,467
Whoa, don't, hey, I am a man.

121
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,027
I will tell her, I will email her.

122
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,627
No, you have to tell
her face to face.

123
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,067
The hell I do.

124
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,947
This is a fragile young woman,
what if she reacts badly?

125
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,067
That's exactly why
I'm doing it on email.

126
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,067
No, you have to tell her the truth
and you have to do it face to face.

127
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,787
Do I?

128
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:01,427
My mum's on Friendface, my mum!

129
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:04,547
It's opened up another channel
of communication with my mum.

130
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:05,707
Isn't that good?

131
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:10,187
No, it is not good. She's put
down her current mood as sensual.

132
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:11,747
Ooh.

133
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,747
Why didn't you just not
accept her as a friend?

134
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,507
Are you an animal?

135
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:19,787
I can't turn down a
friend request from my mum.

136
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,467
Message for me.

137
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,907
Oh.

138
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,107
I am eating my apple, mum.

139
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:33,507
She packed me an apple this morning
and it's the issue of the day.

140
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:36,347
I have to go, I'm meeting an
old school friend for lunch.

141
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:40,307
Isn't it great the way Friendface
brings people together?

142
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:49,907
Nanny's chasing the dog around,
all the kids are screaming,

143
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:52,347
absolute bedlam, and here's me

144
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,707
going to a meeting with the major
shareholders.

145
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,747
My life is an absolute nightmare.

146
00:07:56,747 --> 00:08:00,347
Yes, yes, mine too.

147
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,787
So what about the other
girls, what are they doing?

148
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:04,347
Elaine is head of marketing
at Dennis Publishing.

149
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,867
OK.

150
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,267
She's married to the
editor of Esquire.

151
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:08,267
Is she?

152
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:10,387
Veronica is in A&R with Arista,

153
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:14,627
her big embarrassing story is she
passed on Arctic Monkeys.

154
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,507
Idiot.

155
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,827
Jilly is an architect,
designing a new wing on The Tate.

156
00:08:19,827 --> 00:08:22,507
Jilly, Jilly Spencer?

157
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:25,627
She used to eat the wood on her desk.
I always thought she was slow.

158
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,107
She's a genius.

159
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,547
Wow, everybody's doing great.

160
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:30,787
Yeah.

161
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:33,227
So what about you, Jen?

162
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,507
What are you up to?

163
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,747
What am I up to?

164
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,747
Yeah. Oh, god, I hope
that's not a rude question.

165
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:39,827
No, no, no, no.

166
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:44,067
It would be awful if I just listed
all our successful friends

167
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,947
and you were stuck in some terrible,
dead end job you hated.

168
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,907
Oh, god,
that would be an absolute fucker.

169
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:54,947
No, no, I'm Head of IT
at Reynholm Industries.

170
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:57,707
Oh, I didn't know you were
interested in computers.

171
00:08:57,707 --> 00:09:01,387
Interested is not the word.

172
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:04,347
Sorry.

173
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,507
Hi, babe.

174
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:14,187
You didn't have to call
just to tell me that,

175
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,747
no I can't,

176
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,667
I'm in public. Stop it.

177
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,427
Yeah, of course I'm wearing it.

178
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:27,627
Can I have another one, please?

179
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,387
Hi, Roy.

180
00:09:39,387 --> 00:09:40,827
Hi.

181
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:45,707
Roy, do you have any

182
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:49,427
attractive,
successful-looking friends?

183
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:52,067
No.

184
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,987
What, none at all?

185
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,027
No.

186
00:09:57,467 --> 00:10:00,787
Oh, god, well maybe
you could help me then.

187
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:03,947
Wow, that's flattering.
Are you pissed?

188
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:07,507
A little bit. Could you come
to a school reunion with me

189
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,027
and pretend you're my husband?

190
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,987
Do you really think that you can
quiz me for a better option

191
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,547
and think I'll still say yes?

192
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,267
I'll give you £50.

193
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,747
When is it?

194
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,187
Tomorrow night.

195
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:22,267
I sort of bigged myself up
to this girl, she never had much

196
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:25,627
time for me at school and I wanted
to impress her so, I need a husband.

197
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:29,507
Yeah, I can't because tomorrow
night I'm spending the evening

198
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:33,067
with The Joker. Yeah,
I'm going to do what you said,

199
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,107
I'm gonna tell her the truth, tell
her I'm just not interested in her.

200
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:38,387
Ooh, you're not actually
going to do that face to face?

201
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:42,187
You told me to.

202
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,667
Well,
aren't you worried she'll go mad?

203
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:48,347
I'm very worried about that.

204
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,267
Oh, you are a...oh!
I'm going to cancel.

205
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:54,227
No, no you can't cancel, not now.

206
00:10:57,027 --> 00:10:59,347
Who am I going to ask then?

207
00:10:59,347 --> 00:11:02,267
Who are you going to ask what?

208
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,987
Nothing.

209
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,667
The queen of honesty here needs
someone to pretend to be her husband

210
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,147
at her school reunion.

211
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:12,387
When is it?

212
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:23,227
So, you remember what to do.

213
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,627
Big you up to the max.

214
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:25,267
By?

215
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,107
Listing your fictional achievements.

216
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,227
Uh huh, and?

217
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:30,747
Saying how lucky I am
to have met you

218
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,387
and talking about
our sweet sex life.

219
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:36,427
Maybe not the last one, we
don't want to sound too smug.

220
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,987
If I'm pretending
to be married,

221
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:41,907
I'm pretending to be
sexually active.

222
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:46,147
Don't worry Jen,
I plan on earning this £10.

223
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:48,027
Five now, five later.

224
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,347
Thank you.

225
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:07,147
So...how are you?

226
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:12,747
I'm fine. It was great seeing your
profile pop up on Friendface.

227
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,507
Gave me a great excuse
to get back in touch.

228
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:20,347
Yeah, that's the brilliant thing
about that bloody website.

229
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,107
And how are you?

230
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:24,667
I'm great, I am great, yeah.

231
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,667
I'm glad that we got
together, Alison, because...

232
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:31,707
it's only fair that I be completely
honest with you. The truth is...

233
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,427
Do you mind if
I say something first?

234
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,227
Er...OK.

235
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:37,667
I've never been very
good with words, so...

236
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:40,187
I wrote it down and
it turned into a poem.

237
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:44,547
I'm sorry...
Are you going to read a poem now?

238
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:46,747
Is that what's
actually going to happen?

239
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,267
Yeah, is that all right?

240
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,507
Wouldn't you prefer to text it to me?

241
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,067
It's a bit long for that.

242
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,747
Okey dokey.

243
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:57,187
"Oh, gentle Irish eyes..."

244
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,787
Oh!

245
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:01,667
"tussled brown hair,

246
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,147
"smile as big as
my favourite teddy bear."

247
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:09,387
That's a bit corny, I might take
it out or I might leave it in.

248
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:12,987
"Without you, I am just a husk."

249
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:14,867
I, er... A husk?

250
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:15,987
Yeah.

251
00:13:15,987 --> 00:13:17,867
Uh-huh!

252
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:23,547
"Without you, I am just a husk,
a dead thing,

253
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:30,507
"my new best friend is a razor,
a rope, a noose to swing...in." Oh!

254
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:33,187
"Without you,
the sweet release of death

255
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,147
"would be all that
could give me hope!

256
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:42,747
"When I see your face
on my computer,

257
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:45,787
"I don't just see you.

258
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,267
"I see our future."

259
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,267
Oh, it's...

260
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,707
Oh-oh!

261
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,227
Oh...mmm!

262
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:06,667
Which is how my sexy wife
became the first ginger woman

263
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,187
on the cover of Newsweek.

264
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,547
That is wow.

265
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:15,667
Just when I think I've heard every
story that puts Jen in a good light,
you come up with another one.

266
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:19,307
Yes, and they're beginning to
sound a little bit unbelievable.

267
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,907
Oh, I can't help it!

268
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:24,787
I love this well-travelled high
earner. A woman in the living room,

269
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:28,347
a chef in the kitchen,
a prostitute in the bedroom.

270
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:30,107
Ow!

271
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:36,147
Jen, why don't you tell them
all about your bionic arm?

272
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:43,587
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could do. Or, or
we could talk about something else.

273
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:45,347
Yeah, we've heard
enough stories about Jen.

274
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:46,627
< Yeah!

275
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,747
We want to hear about
the guy that tamed her heart.

276
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,867
Yeah, what do you do, Moss?

277
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,987
I'm a professional tennis player.

278
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,027
Yeah, he doesn't like
talking about it, though, so...

279
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,067
I do.

280
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,067
Where do you play?

281
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,387
Where don't I play.

282
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,147
Wimbledon?

283
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,307
I don't play there.

284
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,827
Are you seeded, Moss?

285
00:15:08,827 --> 00:15:10,987
Bit of a personal question, Terry.

286
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,947
But...

287
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:17,587
yes, I'm highly seeded, we have two
lovely children, Zenith and Quasar.

288
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:20,707
I, I love, I love this song.

289
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:24,427
Let's all stop talking
and dance to this song!

290
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:26,787
POP MUSIC PLAYS

291
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:34,587
Come on, let's dance.

292
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:44,867
Her name is Jen,
er, she's a work colleague.

293
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:48,787
We've been seeing each other
for some time.

294
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:51,107
I love her, I love that woman.

295
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,747
Do you have a picture of her?

296
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,547
A picture of her? No.

297
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,867
What, not even on your phone?

298
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,947
No, it never occurred to me
to take a picture of her,

299
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,587
because I see her all the time.

300
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,107
You just don't want me!

301
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:09,187
Oh, I do, I do, it's, it's...
Why wouldn't I want you?

302
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:10,867
No, it's just, it's this girl.

303
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,347
There is no girl.

304
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,387
There is! It's a real girl.

305
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,547
Look, could you...?
Could you just stop crying?

306
00:16:18,547 --> 00:16:21,187
No, I'm never gonna stop crying!

307
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:25,107
Do you want to meet her?
We can meet her.

308
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:26,107
What, really?

309
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:29,187
Yeah, let's go and meet Jen.

310
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:32,107
Will that make you
a little less mad?

311
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:40,027
Tough, though,
the whole marriage thing.

312
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:43,147
Terry, it's as tough
as a cow's back.

313
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,227
You know what takes
the edge off for me?

314
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:46,227
What?

315
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:47,787
Regular, uninhibited,

316
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:51,907
exploratory sex with a partner
who's even wilder than I am.

317
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,147
That's Jen. She may look like
a ginger angel, but get her

318
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:59,067
behind closed doors and she turns
into Peter Stringfellow.

319
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,147
God, I envy you.

320
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:04,787
These days, Delina hardly
ever lets me, you know, do it.

321
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:08,027
Ah, I'm on Jen at least
four times a day.

322
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,667
As I've already said,
I am fully seeded.

323
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,387
You've got it really
sorted, haven't you?

324
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,987
Yeah, it's very surprising,
isn't it?

325
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:21,267
No offence, Jen, but I've got
to admit I always thought

326
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:25,507
you'd be the one whose life just
went completely off the rails.

327
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:29,307
You always seemed to attract such
chaos at school, but look at you now.

328
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,867
Delina, can we be best friends?

329
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:37,547
Tell you the truth, I think Delina
might be sleeping with someone else.

330
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,227
No, she's just over there.

331
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,547
I mean, this is just
between ourselves.

332
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:43,107
Of course.

333
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:48,067
Little clues here and there,
things only a husband would pick up.

334
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,747
Like, someone wrote a message
on her Friendface wall read,

335
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:55,147
"Can't wait to shag
your arse off again soon."

336
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:59,267
I don't know, maybe
I'm reading too much into it.

337
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:05,107
Still, if I ever found out who
that person was, "Ooh...god."

338
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:07,507
Agh, it's a pickle, Terry.

339
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,707
Women! Oh...

340
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:13,587
If I had a pound for every
bloody woman...

341
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:15,427
Argh...oh!

342
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,947
I hear ya.

343
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,707
Hi there, Jen!

344
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:24,107
What are you doing here?

345
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:27,707
I saw on your profile that
you were having a party.

346
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,907
That's the great thing about
Friendface, I get to see

347
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,867
what all my employees
are doing, all the time.

348
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,227
Come on, be game.

349
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,587
Ah, there she is!
There's Jen!

350
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,187
OK, Jen, I am gonna help you out,
but need you to play along!

351
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:54,667
This is Alison!

352
00:18:57,187 --> 00:19:00,627
She's the friend I told you
about, remember? And this...

353
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,187
This is Jen,
the woman I love!

354
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:05,667
What's going on here?

355
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,427
What are you doing?

356
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:09,827
I'm enjoying an evening
out with my woman.

357
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:13,387
What?!

358
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:16,027
Jen, who is this joker?!

359
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:18,187
No offence!

360
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,787
OK...what the hell is
going on here?

361
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:26,907
Moss is my husband, Roy.

362
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:30,027
But you said you wanted me.
..She really did!

363
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:35,227
It's true, I did want you,
at one point.

364
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:40,307
You were the one that I wanted,
but then you left, you left, Roy,

365
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:44,347
and so I turned to Moss,
and Moss was there for me, Roy.

366
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:48,667
Moss was there for me in a way
that you were not,

367
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:52,427
and now we're together,
and that's all that matters.

368
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,467
I don't know.

369
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,187
What?

370
00:19:58,187 --> 00:19:59,627
I don't know, Jen.

371
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,907
I love you, God knows I do.

372
00:20:03,907 --> 00:20:07,507
Your sweet abandon in bed,
your humanitarian work,

373
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:11,267
you've given me two wonderful
children in Zenith and Quasar.

374
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:15,147
But it sounds to me like you still
have feelings for this young man,

375
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,227
and I'm not sure I can
handle that. I'm not sure at all!

376
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:21,027
I don't. I don't.
I don't have feelings for this man.

377
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:23,907
Yes, you do.

378
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,827
Admit it, Jen!

379
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:30,827
Admit that you have feelings for me,
loudly, here, in front of Alison.

380
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:35,187
No, I don't.
He means nothing to me, Delina.

381
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:40,387
Well, you moved on quickly,
you bitch!

382
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:51,427
How dare you call
my sexy wife a bitch!

383
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:55,947
Do you want to take this outside?

384
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:57,627
With pleasure, sir.

385
00:20:57,627 --> 00:21:00,387
I will just get some of my coats.

386
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:04,027
Excuse me, Alison.

387
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,067
What now?

388
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,067
Hadn't really thought this far.

389
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:27,747
I'll just go and see how they are.

390
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:37,067
Oh, those bloody bastards!

391
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:48,067
Oh, lovely to see Jen!

392
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,707
See her?
I'm shagging her.

393
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:55,067
Grr!

394
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,387
Well, hello there, beautiful.
