00:00:01,564 --> 00:00:03,014
Previously in The IT Crowd:

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:06,177
Douglas received a love potion from
a mysterious blind man in the desert.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:10,447
Enraptured with the lovely Jen Barber,
an employee of Reynholm Industries,

4
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,887
he administers the potion in
the hope of enslaving her heart.

5
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,207
But when Douglas drinks
the concoction by mistake,

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,567
which turns out to be Rohypnol,
he becomes incredibly aroused,

7
00:00:19,577 --> 00:00:22,727
even though Rohypnol would
really only make you tired.

8
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:27,087
Jen locks him in his office with Moss
and Roy, with whom he attempts to
achieve sexual congress.

9
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:30,887
An enraged Jen embarks on a lengthy
legal process using brilliant lawyer

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,127
Jon Rergen,
a friend of her aunty's.

11
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:37,732
After months of legal wrangling an
amicable agreement is finally reached.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,207
You're robbing me blind, Jen.

15
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,580
Sign here, here, here.

16
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:20,087
Yeah, and I reckon I know where to sign
on a sexual harassment settlement,

17
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:21,033
thank you.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,927
I've got to thank you, Jan,
for not taking this matter any further.

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,582
Not only does that show great
maturity but also a... Is she asleep?

20
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:32,673
I'm not asleep.
Not only does that show great
maturity but also a... Is she asleep?

21
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,167
I'm not asleep.

22
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:35,019
All right, all right.

23
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,499
It's not just the money,
you know.

24
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,127
I know.

25
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:38,353
There's a principle involved.

26
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:40,367
Parting with the money
was painful enough,

27
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,500
but the electric pants I have to wear
at work so I don't become aroused,

28
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:45,687
they're
also painful.

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,153
Excuse me,
I'm just charging them.

30
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:53,647
Don't say anything that will
get me going, either of you.

31
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,153
Does it hurt,
you know, when you?

32
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:58,767
It's like being tased
in the balls. Tea?

33
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:00,233
No, thank you.

34
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:04,047
Like being tased in the balls,
except painful.

35
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,140
So, Jen, what are you going
to do with your £500.

36
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:09,860
Don't know.

37
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,980
I still feel we could've got more,
you know.

38
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,780
Now, Jen,
we've been through this.

39
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,887
He tried to use Rohypnol on me.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,407
I thought it was
a magic potion.

41
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,620
Anyway, if this went to court
it'd be your word against mine

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,327
and who are they going to believe?
A woman or an Englishman?

43
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:27,887
Oh, up yours!

44
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,140
That wasn't even sexy.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,487
These pants are broken.

46
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,660
Sorry to bother you, mate. I've just
found out my mum's been taken into

47
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:47,980
hospital. Normally my sister would go
but she's just moved to Australia.

48
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:48,620
Australia?

49
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:51,833
I really need to get down there.
My car's broken down...

50
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:53,900
OK, look, here's 50p.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,287
It's all I've got and it's 50p
more than that story deserved.

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,887
I can't believe you
got more than me.

53
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,407
Why wouldn't we?
Jen, we were violated too.

54
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,487
Violated?! He chased
you around the table.

55
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,673
He kissed Moss.

56
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,220
Right on the lips, apparently.

57
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:15,513
Don't you remember?

58
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,660
I don't remember anything.
I went to Moss's happy place.

59
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,127
You two are useless.

60
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,567
If we'd stuck together we
might've made real money.

61
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,060
£550 is not to be
sniffed at, Jen.

62
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,727
No, and neither is £560.

63
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:32,193
If that's the kind of money I can make,
I'm going to start dressing

64
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,580
even more provocatively.

65
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:37,687
Yeah, we you can save
some of that for Freddy.

66
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:38,673
What's this?

67
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,553
Freddy, that bloke that
did the charity thing where

68
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,107
tied the balloons tothe chair.

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,047
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,393
Such a lovely idea.

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,767
Floating from London to
Glasgow to promote optimism.

72
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,673
Anyway, there's a collection
for his wife and kids,

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,047
so you'd both better cough up.

74
00:03:56,767 --> 00:04:00,167
Moss, what would be
an appropriate amount

75
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,820
to give to Freddy's
wife and kids?

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,713
I suppose normally about £5

77
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,273
but seeing as we just
got all that money, £50?

78
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,689
That seems fair. Let's split the
difference and call it a tenner.

79
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:19,967
Hello?

80
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:22,140
Hello?

81
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,180
Douglas, I know this is you.

82
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,593
Jesus, this bloody thing.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,687
Are you all right, Olive?
You look a bit peaky.

84
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:38,687
Yes, I-I'm,
I don't feel up to it any more.

85
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,207
I feel sort of dizzy
all of a sudden.

86
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,207
Well, you're terrifically old.

87
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:49,167
But don't worry,
not long now till you're at peace.

88
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:09,753
I've done it. Oh, I've done it.

89
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,860
I'm up against the boss now.

90
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,407
Oh, it's a giant
spider shooting out

91
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,490
all these little baby spiders.
That's brilliant.

92
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,633
I'm going nowhere down here.

93
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,527
Nowhere. I'm going to,
ooh, oh, where's Moss?

94
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:24,607
I'm going to finish
this bitch off, Moss.

95
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,247
It's a dead end.

96
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:27,847
They don't come any deader.

97
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:31,247
OK, sweetcheeks,
here comes the pain.

98
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:37,567
You guys,
do you even need a relationship manager?

99
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,567
Stay down! Stay down, bitch!

100
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,327
I'm dead!

101
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:49,687
Oh, no, exactly, Jen, no offence,
but I object to the whole idea that

102
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,410
we even need management,
like we're a

103
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:54,247
pair of nitwits that don't know
how to take care of ourselves.

104
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:56,368
It's...it's insulting
is what it is.

105
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,020
Yeah, yeah,

106
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,340
I suppose you're right.

107
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,220
Sandwich. Oh, right.

108
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,740
Coffee. Oh, no, no, no.

109
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:12,460
Got you!
That one's empty, this is the real one!

110
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:15,207
I've been planning that for ages.
The look on your face!

111
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:30,727
Jen?

112
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:32,220
Yeah?

113
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,167
Don't come in here for a bit.

114
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,713
Why haven't you put
on a clean T-shirt?

115
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,488
I don't have a spare.

116
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,047
Well, someone's looking
for help on 10, so...

117
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:46,313
No, no, Moss can do it.

118
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,580
Moss can't do it,
he's slightly concussed.

119
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:53,780
Yeah, all right, I'll go.

120
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:57,327
Er, I won't be here this afternoon,
I've...I've got a job interview.

121
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,633
Oh, OK, good for you, Jen.

122
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,660
Seriously, we don't need a manager,
it's a non-job.

123
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,113
So you go out there
and you knock 'em dead.

124
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:08,847
Hello, Jen.

125
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:12,967
It's Moss. From work?

126
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,233
For God's sake.

127
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,673
Twats!

128
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:41,193
What happened?
She just collapsed.

129
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,753
I've phoned for an ambulance.
Give us your jacket, mate.

130
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:45,767
What?

131
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,780
She looks cold,
I want to put it round her shoulders.

132
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,967
She doesn't look cold.

133
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,007
What? Just give us
your jacket, man.

134
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,873
She's fine!
You're fine, aren't you, Olive?

135
00:07:57,327 --> 00:07:58,540
She's moving about.

136
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,460
Oh, and she's talking.

137
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:05,047
That's it,
keep the spirits up, Olive.

138
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:06,407
I'm cold!

139
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,410
It's all in your head, Olive.

140
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:09,207
Your jacket, man.

141
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:10,687
– What? – Come on!

142
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,433
Hurry up.

143
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:21,288
Thank you.

144
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,127
Come on. Here we go.

145
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:42,767
Hell's teeth!

146
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,127
I'm not aroused, it's only cars.
God damn these electric sex pants.

147
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:59,528
Isn't it so funny and interesting
that I don't have a shirt on?!

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,953
Oh, hello, let's all make
hilarious comments about it.

149
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,500
Everyone, excuse me, er,

150
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:13,273
as you know,
they found Freddy's body yesterday.

151
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,727
There's nothing I can say that will
make that fact any less horrible.

152
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,073
But perhaps we can bow our heads
for a minute and think about Freddy

153
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
and remember what
he meant to us.

154
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,087
Hey, everybody, look at me!

155
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,127
Let's get it over with, let's all
have a big laugh at the topless man.

156
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,793
Look at me. Ooh, look at me,
I have no shirt, where's my clothes?

157
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,820
Ooh look at these pants.
Am I sexy?

158
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,673
Sexy in my nakedness.

159
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:07,633
We're trying to have a
minute's silence for Freddy,

160
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,127
they found his body yesterday.
If you can give us a couple of minutes.

161
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,487
I work here.
I fucking work here.

162
00:10:39,697 --> 00:10:43,673
Ow. OK. All right. Ow.

163
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,687
Oh, OK...

164
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:53,953
I work in IT!

165
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,233
My pass is in my jacket.

166
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,327
My pass is in my jacket.

167
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,647
This is madness!

168
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:05,490
I work here!

169
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,047
It's madness !

170
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,117
Lovely cup of tea.

171
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:35,117
Ahh, thank you.

172
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:39,033
Well, I have to say,
I like what I see, Jen.

173
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,673
You're young,
ambitious, intelligent,

174
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,460
just the sort of person
I like to have around.

175
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,060
Well, I'm no Stephen
Hawking, don't get me wrong.

176
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,140
But you can't work
as long as I have

177
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:58,767
in IT without having a pretty
firm grasp of the essentials.

178
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,420
You know,

179
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,340
what exactly does IT stand for?

180
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:06,127
I've often wondered,
but I've never thought to ask.

181
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,260
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

182
00:12:15,447 --> 00:12:17,513
What does IT stand for?

183
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,207
What does it stand for?

184
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,717
What doesn't it stand for?

185
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,033
Yes, yes,
but what does it stand for?

186
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,740
It stands for...

187
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,197
It stands for...

188
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,567
Commitment.

189
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:41,320
It stands for audacity,
it stands for courage in the face of...

190
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,167
Yes, yes.
I can see what you're getting at.

191
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:48,717
But the specific letters –
I, T. What do they stand for?

192
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,940
What do you think
they stand for?

193
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,639
No. Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear.

194
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,637
I'm don't want
an interpretation.

195
00:12:55,652 --> 00:12:59,518
I really don't know what the
letters actually stand for.

196
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:01,997
So let's start with the I.

197
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,119
What does the I stand for?

198
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,993
I need to wee-wee.
I mean go to the toilet,

199
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,807
I need to go to
the toilet, sorry.

200
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,673
I don't normally say "wee-wee",
it's just I'm bursting.

201
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,167
Hello, Roy speaking.

202
00:13:29,313 --> 00:13:30,673
What? Moss?

203
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,033
You're concussed,
you need a doctor.

204
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,020
Who is this? Roy?
Wait, it couldn't be Roy, I'm Roy.

205
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,793
What does IT mean?

206
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:38,727
What?

207
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,007
IT, what does it mean?

208
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,953
Someone just asked me.

209
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,407
You don't know what it means?

210
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:44,327
No, I never thought to ask.

211
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,780
This must be Jen.

212
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:47,393
Yes.

213
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,487
Hello, Jen.

214
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:49,273
Hello.

215
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,553
How may I help you?

216
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,233
Oh! Tell me what IT means.

217
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,727
Absolutely.

218
00:13:58,447 --> 00:13:59,180
Well?

219
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,237
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

220
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,117
Just stay with me for
this simple question.

221
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,580
Jen, I'm just going to
put you on speakerphone.

222
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:07,847
No, don't hang...

223
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,500
Jen, you are now
on speaker phone.

224
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:15,793
Jen?

225
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,140
Hello, Jen?

226
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:22,673
Jen, can you bear with me one moment?

227
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,017
I've got someone
trying to get through the other line.

228
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:26,687
Roy speaking.

229
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:27,820
You just hung up on me.

230
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:30,037
Jen, hold on,
I've got Jen on the other line.

231
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,193
No, you can't.

232
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,420
Jen, can I call you back,
I've got Jen on the other line.

233
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,100
Jen, sorry about that.

234
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,887
Chicken in a basket,
it's been all ruddy go today.

235
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,927
Now, how may I help you?

236
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,997
What does IT mean?

237
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,073
You know, computers,

238
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,540
something to do with
computers, probably.

239
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,380
Computers? That's
not really my area.

240
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:01,127
Jen I'd love to help you
but it's a real pain,

241
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,327
I seem to have forgotten
everything I know about computers.

242
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:07,060
How can you forget
everything about computers, Moss?

243
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,557
Let me see.
Maybe it isn't everything.

244
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:13,500
No, it's definitely everything.

245
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:41,087
Excuse me, can I trouble you
for 50 pence for a phone call?

246
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,700
Excuse me, mate,
I'm sorry to bother you, but, er,

247
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:52,397
my mate threw coffee all over me and
then this old woman stole my jacket,

248
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:55,180
and they chucked me out of
the building where I work.

249
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,113
And now I just need 50p for a phone
call so I can get back to work.

250
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,993
Oh, that's better.

251
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,087
Good, good.

252
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,073
Now, er, where were we?

253
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:23,713
Oh, God, I can't remember.
I hate it when that happens.

254
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,807
Wow, is this a wooden desk?

255
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:31,460
Oh, no, I remember,
you were going to tell me what IT means.

256
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,140
Right.

257
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,517
I don't know what it means,
all right?

258
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:39,247
I never thought to...
it didn't really affect me

259
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,313
as I'm too busy
managing one man

260
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,447
whose idea of an adult night out
is Laser Quest and pornography.

261
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,873
And another who collects wires.

262
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:50,580
Have you heard Guided By Voices?
They're a band.

263
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,237
No.

264
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,247
I have.

265
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:54,340
I've heard everything
they've ever done.

266
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:57,073
They're good,
I'm a bit of a fan now.

267
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:58,220
Isn't that good?

268
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,687
I shouldn't even
know who they are.

269
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,727
They've turned me
into one of them.

270
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,767
I am one of them.

271
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,633
That's why you need me.

272
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,113
I am your conduit,

273
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:20,527
I am your
bridge. Ich...bin...ein...Nerd.

274
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:27,607
Welcome aboard.

275
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:34,357
Oh, oh.

276
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:39,487
How can that be erotic?

277
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,073
Good God!

278
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,887
Get me IT.

279
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:24,500
You there, computer man.
Fix my pants.

280
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,340
I beg your pardon.

281
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:30,060
Pull down my trousers
and do your job.

282
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:52,900
Roy?

283
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,527
Jen?

284
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:01,860
Jen!

285
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:04,380
Jen!

286
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,900
Oh, Jen!

287
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,047
Oh!

288
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:13,167
It's been horrible!

289
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:17,420
Horrible. The worst
two hours of my life.

290
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:20,567
Oh.

291
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:24,820
All right.

292
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,633
Hello, everybody, and welcome

293
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:31,757
to this our first inter-faith
tour of Reynholm Industries.

294
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,207
I thought we'd start with the IT
department because, to be honest,

295
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,633
we do tend to forget about them,
buried down in the basement.

296
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,153
And they really
are lovely guys.

297
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:46,047
Let's go in and say hello.

298
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,207
But I don't know what it is.

299
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:50,160
Just pull that thing,
fiddle about with it.

300
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:58,677
Fuck off!

301
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,727
Try that wire.

302
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,367
Who are you?

303
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,340
Free at last,
I could get to like this.

304
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,207
Just the job, good work.

305
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,887
Hmmm, nice and loose.

306
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,033
I'm in my happy place,
I'm in my happy place.

307
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,047
I'm in my happy place.

308
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm in my happy place.
I'm in my happy place.

309
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:29,273
I'm in my happy place.

310
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,873
Hello.

311
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,140
Hello, June.

312
00:20:49,193 --> 00:20:51,540
Jen, hello! How can I help you?

313
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:53,033
I'd like to say thank you,

314
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,180
but I have to turn
your offer down.

315
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:58,557
Oh. Well,
I'm sorry to hear that. Why?

316
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,113
Personal reasons.

317
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:07,820
OK. Well, if you change your mind,
you know where I am.

318
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:08,513
Thank you.

319
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:12,433
Oh, by the way, did you ever
find out what IT stands for?

320
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:13,393
Piss off, June.

321
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,727
Who wants tea?
