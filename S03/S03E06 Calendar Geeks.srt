1
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,438
– Have you nearly finished, Roy?
– Yep.

2
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:48,082
– You're taking a very long time.
– It's a very complicated problem.

3
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:52,758
You've got a lot of... chabaranks in your
hard drive. I'll get them out eventually.

4
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:55,401
Frustrating!

5
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:59,122
Come on, work!
Work, you bloody computer!

6
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,956
– Nadine, do you know about digital cameras?
– Oh, Roy might.

7
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,716
I do, as it happens. I'm an amateur
photographer, actually.

8
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:11,045
I just got this new one,
but it's really complicated.

9
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,680
That's fixed.

10
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,685
– What was wrong with it?
– Wasn't turned on.

11
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:20,197
I don't even know why I got rid
of my old one - it was working fine.

12
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,125
Well, these all
look good.

13
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:25,681
What's going on with this fella?!

14
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:30,676
Look at him! He's pulling a mad face!
He looks completely mental.

15
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:35,881
That's Dave, my brother.
He's got a very serious condition.

16
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:44,764
When I said "mental" there, I meant
mental in the sense of... intelligent.

17
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:49,243
You know, like he's a big reader.

18
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:52,643
_ He has boss-eyedness.
– Bossiednis?

19
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,166
He's permanently boss-eyed.

20
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,035
That must be a big pain in the arse.

21
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:04,718
It is. And the terrible thing is, people think
there's actually something funny about this.

22
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:09,318
No! Who could think
there's something funny about this?

23
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:15,366
But it's a proper condition
and he really suffers, he really...

24
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,520
Oh, hey...

25
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,684
I'd just give anything
if Dave could have a normal life.

26
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,322
– Oh, hey now...
– Kimberly, are you OK?

27
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,324
It's just... Dave.

28
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,756
Oh, poor Dave.

29
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,519
Hey, I've got a great idea.

30
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:34,923
Why don't we do something
to raise money for people like Dave?

31
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:38,642
You know, like... We must be able
to think of something... Like a fun run!

32
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:41,600
– That's a good idea.
– Or a nude calendar.

33
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,604
Yes!

34
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:47,117
I would say that's maybe even a better
idea than the fun-run idea.

35
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,603
We could call it "The girls of the 7th floor".

36
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,238
Yes!

37
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:58,919
– It's a very strong theme.
– Roy could be the photographer!

38
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:03,598
I could do the photographs. Because
I said I was an amateur photographer.

39
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,844
Let's do a brainstorm.
I'd like to be November, if that's OK.

40
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,719
– Can I be April?
– Yes.

41
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:12,726
In October we've got to have
a Halloween theme...

42
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,201
Boss-eyedness is something
which affects 1% of Britons.

43
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:26,482
It doesn't impair eyesight, yet people with
boss-eye are routinely discriminated against.

44
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:30,395
Just like any form of discrimination,
it should be stopped.

45
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,200
But we can only do so with your help.

46
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,795
That's right –
we're looking at you.

47
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,147
It's not funny, Jen.

48
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:46,685
– It's a very serious condition.
– I know it is. I know it is. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:51,085
Look, this is exactly the kind of
discrimination we are fighting against.

50
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:55,405
– And what do you need from me?
– I just need a little time off work.

51
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,326
We're trying to raise money
for the boss-eyed.

52
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,885
– Who? Who is?
– Just me and some people.

53
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,076
Oh, yeah? Who?

54
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:08,596
Some people from upstairs.
You wouldn't know them.

55
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,763
– OK. What are you gonna do?
– Well...

56
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,479
– Hi.
– Hi.

57
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,440
– Hiya.
– What are you talking about?

58
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:20,038
Nothing. I'm just talking to Jen
about a private project.

59
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,725
What is it?

60
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:26,477
It's just a private project I'm doing
that's private.

61
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,565
What is it?

62
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:33,715
It's just a thing. It's just a big bloody
pain-in-the-arse thing that I might do.

63
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:35,963
Oh, you are being modest.

64
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:40,080
It's a very kind thing you're doing,
very generous, very charitable.

65
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:42,163
I really am impressed.
Good for you.

66
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:48,082
What's he done, persuaded all the girls
on seven to do a nude calendar for charity?!

67
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:56,957
– Bye.
– Bye, Moss.

68
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:05,640
– Oh, God, he's right.
– Oh, no... How the hell... No, no...

69
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,396
He made it sound sleazy!
– It is sleazy!

70
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,757
Oh, what kind of man
would want to photograph

71
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,720
a bunch of beautiful women
without any clothes on, Roy?

72
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,317
The kind of man
who wants to help people, Jen!

73
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:22,804
– No, I don't like it. I find it very offensive.
– No, it's going to be tasteful.

74
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,645
No, it's not.

75
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,999
You're right, it's not. It's not.
It's going to be rude. It's going to be sexy.

76
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:32,597
All the things men like. And it'll
make a million quid for that charity.

77
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,161
– No, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
– Why not?

78
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:40,680
Taking your clothes off... If it's unemployed
men or old ladies from Yorkshire, it's fun.

79
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:45,676
If it's sexy women, it's not fun, it's oppression.
No, I will not give you any time off for this.

80
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:49,004
Well, OK. Then I will
do it in my own time.

81
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,563
– Roy, you're behaving like a horny teenager.
– No, you are.

82
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:56,362
– For God's sake, try and have some dignity.
– No, I won't. I won't.

83
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,966
– Sit down.
– No, I won't sit down.

84
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:01,523
– Try and have an adult conversation.
– I'm doing it. It's for charity.

85
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,763
And there's nothing you can do about it!

86
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,923
You're embarrassing yourself!

87
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,117
Roy, stop it! Come back here!

88
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:10,761
Roy, don't be silly, come back!
Roy!

89
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:18,124
– I'm really pleased we've had this talk.
– Thanks for seeing us.

90
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,842
– Any advice you need about anything...
– Oh, you're so lovely.

91
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,002
Hiya.

92
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:28,281
Roy, thank God you're here. Jen's been telling
us how the calendar would've been sexist...

93
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:29,522
Oh, has she?

94
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:32,798
How it'd be much better
if we used old ladies or unemployed men.

95
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:35,157
Oh, good.

96
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:39,246
She thinks we'll make a lot more money
because of the "ah" factor.

97
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:40,482
The "ah" factor?

98
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:44,441
The thing that makes you go, "Ah"
when you hear about it.

99
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, yeah...

100
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:51,326
But will anyone actually want to see old
women or destitute men with no clothes on?

101
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:55,520
Won't that just make people go, "Agh!",
rather than "Ah"?

102
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:59,799
Guys, I've got a great idea. Why don't we
all ask our grans to do the calendar?

103
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:02,361
That is a great idea!

104
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:08,119
Nadine, you are so full of ideas.
But can I... Hold on one second.

105
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:14,482
What's our theme? Isn't our theme "Girls of
the 7th floor"? That was a very strong theme.

106
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:18,759
Yes, Roy, but now the theme
can be "Grans of the girls of the 7th floor".

107
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:22,163
Oh, yeah...
I don't want to take photos of grannies.

108
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:27,122
This could do very well, Roy. This could be
tasteful. Like the one Helen Mirren did.

109
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,922
Old ladies, pot plants covering their bits...
you know the sort of thing.

110
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,562
An erotic calendar
the whole family could enjoy.

111
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,918
Roy, you can't drop out now.
Douglas has paid for the studio time.

112
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,596
– What? Has he?
– Yeah. He's very interested in this project.

113
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:46,323
And I just have to say how I'm finding
this whole thing just... so moving,

114
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:50,486
how so many men have come to me, have shown
interest and support for the calendar.

115
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:54,885
I mean, people really do care
about the boss-eyeds.

116
00:07:58,087 --> 00:08:01,602
Roy... you can't drop out now.

117
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,206
I wasn't... wrong about you, was I, Roy?

118
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,877
I thought you were special.

119
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,077
I am.

120
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:15,165
I'm so special. I... No... I...

121
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,916
Let's do it!
Let's go round up those grans!

122
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:25,642
Thank you! Oh, thank you!

123
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,644
That's OK.

124
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,038
– Hi.
– Hi!

125
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,965
You don't have to do this, you know, Roy,
we could just get a proper photographer.

126
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:40,317
– Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.
– OK.

127
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,519
– How's it going?
– Not a great start, I have to say.

128
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:49,279
Of all the girls on seven,
only nine have grans that are still alive.

129
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:56,165
Of that nine, one is having a...
hip replacement on the day of the shoot,

130
00:08:56,287 --> 00:09:02,123
one is a little... senile
and may not know what's happening...

131
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:07,321
and the last one...
the last one has a gangrenous arm.

132
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,477
But she still wants to do it.

133
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:16,158
So all I have to do now is hit the streets
and find six old women that I've never met

134
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,360
who'd be happy to take all their clothes off
and let me take photographs of them.

135
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,725
Why are you doing this?

136
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:27,045
Same reason I do everything, Jen...
to have sex with a lady.

137
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,517
What?

138
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,597
I said,
"Do you want to be in a nude calendar?"

139
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,477
– Do I want a calendar?
– No, no. No.

140
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,237
Do you... want...

141
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,877
to do...

142
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:56,877
a nude calendar?

143
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,997
For charity.
– Oh, for charity!

144
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,637
Oh, well, in that case, yes, I'll take it.
How much is it?

145
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:05,227
No, no, no. No, no. No.

146
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:08,837
Do you want to do a calendar?

147
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:12,157
But the doctor's already changed my catheter.

148
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,667
No, no... No.

149
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:22,437
I need you... to take all your clothes off...
and have me take photographs of you.

150
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,837
Oh, you remembered
your old mum's birthday.

151
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,277
IT?

152
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:38,637
Jen, hi.
I just wanted you to know

153
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:42,597
if this calendar doesn't make a million pounds,
I'm holding you responsible.

154
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,677
What?! That's not very fair.

155
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:48,557
I'm sad to say that the only secure route
to a knighthood in this sorry age

156
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,477
is via charity work.

157
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,717
You can't do that.
It wasn't my idea.

158
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,317
Nonetheless.
The idea came from your department,

159
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,637
and as head of the department
it's your nuts on the block.

160
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,677
– Oh, Mr. Reynholm...
– Don't worry, Jen.

161
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,997
Just make it as sexy as hell
and watch the money pour in.

162
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,747
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Every page sexier than the last.

163
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,477
Mr. Reynholm...

164
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:18,877
Oh, grans... Grans aren't sexy.
That's not gonna make any money.

165
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,237
What kind of society are we living in?!

166
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:29,517
– What?
– Apparently we live in the kind of society

167
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:34,437
that sees a man who just wants
to take naked photos of some old ladies

168
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,677
as some sort of weirdo!

169
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:43,477
Who deserves to be chased and shouted at
and beaten... and chased...

170
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,917
– Did you tell them it's for the boss-eyeds?
– Oh, I did, I did.

171
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:51,957
I did tell them that, Jen, and you
know what? They just laughed at me.

172
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,037
What?

173
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:57,477
They just laughed at me, Jen.
They don't care about the boss-eyeds.

174
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:02,437
Wait, Roy. You know what? Maybe
we should rethink the theme a little bit.

175
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:06,517
"Grans of the girls of the 7th floor"...
it's such a mouthful.

176
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:09,917
Why don't we just bring it back
to "Girls of the 7th floor"?

177
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,747
– You said it was sexist.
– It's empowering!

178
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:17,917
Sexist! How dare you be so patronising?
– Oh, you... Whoa-whoa-whoa...

179
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,717
And you'd enjoy it, Roy. Yeah, you'd love
to take those photos, wouldn't you?

180
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:26,627
You'd enjoy taking those photos.
I bet you would. You'd enjoy that a lot more.

181
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,997
D'you know what I'm talking about?

182
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,757
– I don't know.
– Oh, come on!

183
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:35,877
No, no. I don't think
Kimberly would like it.

184
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,477
And I don't want to make any wrong moves.
I cannot blow this one.

185
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:44,277
Kimberly is the best thing that ever happened
to me, and she hasn't happened to me yet.

186
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:48,187
We are not gonna make any money
with grannies.

187
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,397
I'm back!

188
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,837
– What? What do you mean?
– I'm back. From holiday.

189
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:59,877
– You were on holiday?
– Yes, I was on holiday.

190
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,467
– Oh, that's right...
– Yes, yes, yes...

191
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:07,757
– You didn't know I was on holiday?
– No, no, no, we did. Where did you go?

192
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:11,077
You didn't know I was on holiday!

193
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:15,037
Oh, we did, we did... We missed you.

194
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,877
I've been gone a week!

195
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,237
– A week?!
– Wow!

196
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,077
What?

197
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,557
-–You know what's very in at the moment?
– I don't.

198
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,757
Geeks. You lot.

199
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:37,317
The whole nerd thing.
Geek chic. It's very in.

200
00:14:37,447 --> 00:14:39,157
So?

201
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:44,277
So it's a calendar
that celebrates scientific achievement?

202
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,957
– That's right.
– About time!

203
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,277
Think of it as an opportunity
to re-enact all of your favourite moments

204
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:54,917
from the history of science.

205
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:58,077
And maths?

206
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:00,277
– And maths.
– Yes!

207
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:03,997
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

208
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:05,997
Yep?
– OK, are they all there?

209
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:09,237
– Yep.
– You rounded up your best-looking friends?

210
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,797
Yep.

211
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:15,797
OK, great, Roy. Remember, it's gotta be sexy.
Sexy, sexy, sexy.

212
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,317
Yep.

213
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:25,637
OK, so...
if the rest of you want to take lunch...

214
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,187
I'll do Moss first.

215
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:34,797
Laters.

216
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,837
So I'll hold up the beaker
like, "Ah! I've discovered something."

217
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,757
– Exactly. Yes.
– But what have I discovered?

218
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:45,237
– It doesn't matter.
– I think it does a bit, actually.

219
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,477
OK, you have discovered... nuclear bombs.

220
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,037
In a beaker?

221
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:56,477
You're right. It's surprising.
So give me "surprised".

222
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,237
Yeah! That's it.

223
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,667
And it's confusing.

224
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,997
Yes. You're "confused".

225
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:09,717
And you are afraid of the consequences...
Give me fear! Fear!

226
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,227
Yeah. That's good. That's good.

227
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,357
OK, nice, nice.

228
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:19,317
And... if... if you're
hot or anything, Moss,

229
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:23,197
maybe you could undo
some buttons on your shirt.

230
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:25,317
No, I'm all right, thanks, Roy.

231
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,237
Maybe just undo your top button.

232
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,717
Why?

233
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:35,357
It's hot. It's a hot lab.
Because of all the... fusion.

234
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,757
– Fission!
– Fission. Yeah.

235
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,237
That's it.

236
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,427
Maybe just one more button.

237
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,677
OK. That's good.

238
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:55,227
And maybe you could...
maybe you could get down on all fours.

239
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,357
Why?

240
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:03,037
Because you had some microscopic
nuclear things and you dropped them.

241
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,597
– Oh, did I? Oh...
– Big klutz!

242
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,997
– Oh, nightmare! Oh...
– They're down there somewhere.

243
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:13,277
– It's a pain. Oh, where are they?
– Yeah... And you're getting angry.

244
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,117
– Well, I would. It's frustrating.
– Because you can't find them.

245
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,197
You know how you growl
if you can't find stuff.

246
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,237
That's it.

247
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:25,837
And there are other people in the lab
and they're being so noisy.

248
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,397
OK.

249
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,357
That's it.

250
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,157
– Bit less of...
– Yes.

251
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,317
And... and then it occurs to you

252
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:38,227
that maybe you put your microscopic
nuclear things in your back pocket.

253
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,077
Oh, did I? Oh...

254
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:45,547
That's a pain. Why would they be there?
And yet I've put them there.

255
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,677
– Yeah.
– It's strange.

256
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:48,757
Yeah...

257
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,837
– You're working hard. You're tired.
– Well, I've been busy.

258
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:56,957
Oh, they're being noisy again. Shush them.

259
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:00,197
That's good, Moss. Yeah...

260
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:05,837
OK, so just give me a cheeky
sort of "I've been a naughty boy" look.

261
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,227
But I've just solved Fermat's Theorem.

262
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,757
Yes, but... you solved it in a way

263
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,797
that the stuffed shirts of the time
would've found very naughty.

264
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:24,637
Am I Fermat?
Because if I am, these clothes are wrong.

265
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:30,597
Yeah... You're more...
You're a naughty mathematician.

266
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:35,747
Roy, you're doing it wrong.
The lighting is all wrong.

267
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:40,397
The pictures are gonna be very gloomy, Roy.
This whole set-up is inadequate.

268
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:45,917
It's a celebration.
You've just discovered penicillin.

269
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:54,117
But why are our tops off?

270
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,957
I always take my top off when
I'm celebrating. Don't you?

271
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,437
Oh, yeah, I suppose so.
Yeah, of course.

272
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,437
OK... Cavort!

273
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,157
That's it.

274
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,877
Yeah!

275
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,517
Thank God for all that penicillin.

276
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:22,117
Touch each other
in a celebratory way.

277
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,517
Yeah! That's it.

278
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,837
Yeah... Yes...

279
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,437
That's good.

280
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:34,277
That's it. Ruffle your hair.

281
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,597
That's good. OK. Nice, nice.

282
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,797
That's it. Look over like that...

283
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:52,597
You... pick him up,
like a wheelbarrow,

284
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:56,997
and you walk with him,
and then you come in this way. OK?

285
00:19:57,527 --> 00:20:00,677
Like any form of discrimination,
it should be stopped.

286
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,107
But we can only do
so with your help.

287
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:06,237
That's right –
we're looking at you.

288
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:10,597
Thank you.
I just wanted to say a few words.

289
00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:13,027
Hey, come on. We did it.

290
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:19,117
This is exciting, isn't it? Reynholm Industries'
first sexy new charity calendar.

291
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,677
Come on, goofy!
We wanna see the calendar!

292
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:29,277
I can't wait. I hereby announce that
speech over and the calendar ready to go.

293
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:34,547
And I think I speak for all men here
when I say I can't wait to get that box open

294
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,157
and feast my eyes upon its sexy contents!

295
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:49,757
Whoa! Someone's played
an awful prank.

296
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,797
There's nothing here
but gloomy pictures of morons.

297
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:57,237
No, not morons. Geeks.
They're sexy now – you know, geek chic.

298
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:01,197
Geek chic? I wanna tear my eyes out!

299
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,757
This is horrible! Horrible!

300
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:08,637
– This is your fault.
– It was Roy's idea.

301
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:13,477
You idiot! I wouldn't buy this
and it's in aid of me!

302
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,837
– I didn't do it.
– I'm talking to her!

303
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,637
It's hard to tell with your mad eyes.

304
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:22,077
– Sorry we're late.
– Oh, here are the calendars! Brilliant!

305
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:25,987
Oh, great! We're on a calendar.
Box-fresh!

306
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:34,317
There goes the entire audience
for our calendar.

307
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,717
And they got it for free.

308
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:46,597
Roy, I don't care
that no one liked the calendar.

309
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:50,757
That was... the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

310
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:53,237
– Really?
– Really.

311
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,077
The doctor's already changed my catheter.

312
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:07,157
Roy? What's wrong?

313
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,237
Nothing.

314
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:14,077
No, I...
Don't let me stop the kissing. Let's...

315
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,117
– Oh, no...
– Roy, are you OK?

316
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,837
I'm just tired.

317
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,437
Let's...

318
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,197
Cavort!

319
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:36,437
– You're doing it wrong.
– Cavort!

320
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:40,267
– You're doing it wrong.
– The doctor's already changed my catheter.

321
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:53,317
Roy, what is it?

322
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,157
Kimberly...

323
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,557
it's not gonna work out.
