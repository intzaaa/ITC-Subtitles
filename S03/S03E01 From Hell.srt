1
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:27,037
"The IT Crowd": season 3, episode 1.

2
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,637
I could have brought it
in tomorrow, you know.

3
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:36,477
You didn't have
to follow me home.

4
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:38,837
Jen, I know what it's like,
lending money.

5
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,997
You do not want it hanging over you.

6
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:44,827
It's better I just get it back now
before it becomes this big thing between us.

7
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:49,437
You gave it to me two hours ago
and you literally haven't left my side since!

8
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:53,637
I am never going to borrow money
off you again. You're a nightmare.

9
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,547
– There, £5. God!
– Thanking you.

10
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,247
– Hi, Jen.
– Gary, hi. How's it going?

11
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,797
– Good. I've finished that first wall.
– Great. That was quick.

12
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,077
Gary's doing a bit of
work around the house.

13
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,197
Hello.

14
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:12,717
– Have we met?
– No, I don't think so.

15
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:14,597
You just look...

16
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:17,187
– I'd better crack on.
– OK.

17
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,837
– Bye, Roy.
– He's...

18
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:22,077
– Yeah, all right. Time to go.
– I don't think...

19
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,717
– Get out.
– No, wait! Wait.

20
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,147
It can wait till tomorrow.

21
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:42,797
– Hey, where are you going?
– Nice glasses, mate!

22
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:45,757
You look a right
old muppet in them!

23
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:53,437
– Why didn't you tell me this last night?
You wouldn't let me.

24
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:58,877
– Builders From Hell?!
– I'm sure it was one of those programmes.

25
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,437
– Gary's a builder from hell?
– I think so.

26
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,517
– Oh, so you're not sure?
– Jen, I'm 99% sure.

27
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:06,947
Well... what did he do?

28
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:10,957
The work was fine, there was
nothing wrong with the work,

29
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,387
but then they caught him...

30
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,317
He pissed in the sink.

31
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:22,757
Yeah...

32
00:02:22,887 --> 00:02:24,757
– Which sink?
– All the sinks.

33
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,957
Yeah, he basically went on
a pee parade around the house.

34
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,157
– Oh, God, I have to fire him.
– I think you should, yeah.

35
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,317
I'm 95% sure it was him.

36
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,557
You... you said you were 99% sure.

37
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:41,397
I'm 97% sure it was him.

38
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:44,677
I– I have to get home.
I have to get home.

39
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,037
Hey, man.

40
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,717
– You OK?
– Yeah.

41
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,797
– Are you sure?
– Yeah.

42
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:01,957
Wait. Was it those bullies again?

43
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,037
Yeah.

44
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,357
Oh. What do they do exactly?

45
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,917
They make hurtful comments, Roy.

46
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:15,677
You have to learn
how to stand up for yourself, man.

47
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:19,277
OK, let's try something.
Let's do some role play, OK?

48
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:24,267
– Do you think that would be a good idea?
– It certainly helped me learn how to buy sandwiches.

49
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,627
OK.

50
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,437
Let's go for it, OK?
So, I'll be those bullies on the bench.

51
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,077
– What, all of them?
– No, just one of them.

52
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:38,037
– Which one?
– I don't know them, Moss.

53
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,237
I'm a bully on the bench,
and you're going to walk past me.

54
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:45,237
But this time,
after I make a "hurtful comment",

55
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,397
come back at me with something, OK?

56
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,477
Get all up in my shit.

57
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,357
All right? OK.

58
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:55,397
Oh, no. Wait, wait, wait.
What do they usually say?

59
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,597
– They mention my glasses.
– OK, let's start with that.

60
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:06,317
Them glasses is shit, innit?

61
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,397
It's too real, Roy!
It's too real!

62
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,637
– I won't do the voice.
– Thank you.

63
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,957
OK.

64
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:19,397
OK.

65
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:23,637
– Nice glasses.
– Yeah...

66
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:27,437
...maybe the reason
I have to wear glasses

67
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,797
is because I suffer from short–sightedness

68
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:32,837
and I can't... I won't...
I can't put contact lenses in

69
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,757
cos I'm frightened of touching my eyes.

70
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:42,037
I can't... There's no way that these
glasses... I can't... And there's no...

71
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,037
– Yeah.
– Yeah.

72
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,837
Stupid hair!

73
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,357
Mr Reynholm,
you seem to lack a basic understanding

74
00:04:57,487 --> 00:05:00,077
of exactly how much trouble
this company's in!

75
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,837
We have a financial crisis here,

76
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:06,317
and if you don't mind me saying,
your attitude seems to me incredibly cavalier.

77
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,037
What?

78
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,917
I can't hear you.
Can't you see we're having an iPod party?

79
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,197
– Mr Reynholm, please!
– What?

80
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:20,477
Sorry girls, you'd better go.

81
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,997
Girls, ship it!

82
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,517
Best accounting team I've ever had.

83
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:39,267
– What's your problem?
– This is the problem. The iPod parties are the problem.

84
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:43,557
The gold flakes in the drinking water
are the problem.

85
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,837
The obscene amount you spend on erotic art.

86
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:50,957
– Easy there! That's an original.
– Do you know how much trouble we're in?

87
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,877
Do you know what the shareholders
are going to do with us?

88
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:59,237
– I'm sorry, but you were getting hysterical.
– No, I wasn't!

89
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,037
– You seemed hysterical.
– No!

90
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:04,197
Anyway, don't worry about the shareholders.
I can handle them.

91
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:08,917
But you've missed every meeting with them
for seven weeks. Where were you last time?

92
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,117
You're going to hate me for this,
but I fancied the day off,

93
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,277
so I took some of the pension money
out of the bank

94
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:18,117
and I lost it on a horse.

95
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:19,757
Yes!

96
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,037
– Gambling with our employees' pensions?
– Gambling? No.

97
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,357
I was riding the horse –
it fell out of my pocket.

98
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:28,717
Oh, my God!
I'm not hysterical!

99
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,877
Hi, Gary.

100
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,757
Hello.

101
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:42,197
I thought I'd work from home today.

102
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,717
Sorry, bit out of breath.

103
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:50,437
Hope you don't mind.

104
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:54,157
No. Not at all.

105
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:06,237
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but
you said you had a problem with your laptop.

106
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,317
– Mind if IT fiddle about while we speak?
– Well, actually, I...

107
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,117
Yeah, no, good.

108
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,197
I can't seem to get it open.

109
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,437
You want me to open it?!

110
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,187
That's why you called me all the way up here,
to open your laptop?!

111
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:25,477
I would be beholden to you.

112
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,597
No problem.

113
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:37,367
– Given the delicate nature of our...
– Money, money, money!

114
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:41,237
That's the problem with you people –
it's always about money.

115
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:44,117
Roy, give me £20.

116
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,637
– What?
– Give me £20. I'll pay you back.

117
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:51,157
Yeah...

118
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,397
You know what I think of money?

119
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,637
That's what I think of money.

120
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,717
You've opened it.

121
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,917
Thanks, Roy.

122
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,397
You're welcome.

123
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,837
You do know Japan have expressed concern?

124
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,347
What, the whole country?

125
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:41,397
No, not the whole...
Mr Yamamoto.

126
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:44,597
– He's important, isn't he?
– He's the major shareholder.

127
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,677
He's effectively your partner.

128
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:51,637
He said, "I do hope we do not have
our own Conrad Black at Reynholm Industries".

129
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:58,037
Conrad Black – the first rich person
to go to prison in 300 years.

130
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,437
– You see it's serious?
– What do you want from me?

131
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:04,437
I want you to stay out of trouble.
Do nothing until the conference call tomorrow.

132
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:11,437
Let me get this right.
You want me to do absolutely nothing?

133
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,917
Just stay out of trouble –
that's all I ask.

134
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:16,877
You want me to sit on my arse all day?

135
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,067
I think I can handle that.

136
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:31,957
I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer.

137
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,797
Wow! A gun!

138
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:47,457
Roy, I'd love to take you through

139
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,737
my changes to the video-conferencing
system in the meeting room,

140
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,057
but maybe I'm boring you.

141
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,897
– I'll never see that £20 again!
– I can't believe you're not interested

142
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,657
in the sweet flip switch I've installed.

143
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:04,217
£20 doesn't even register to him
as an amount of money!

144
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:07,057
He won't remember it.

145
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,147
IT. Have you tried turning it...

146
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:15,897
Is this the guy? I need to know.
I can't sit here all day staring at him.

147
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,257
It really looked like him, Jen.
I'm 80% sure it's him.

148
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,857
– Are you winding me up?!
– What?

149
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,937
You've gone down 15%!

150
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,657
It's still high.

151
00:10:26,787 --> 00:10:31,727
I am sitting here like an idiot,
and you've gone down about 15%!

152
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:36,497
Jen, how can you be keeping an eye on him
while you're talking to me as well?

153
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:56,017
– Hi, Gary.
– All right?

154
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,177
Sorry, I thought you were in the toilet.

155
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,817
I just wondered...
if you fancied a cup of tea.

156
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,697
– Just made you one.
– Yeah.

157
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:10,177
Great. Thanks.

158
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,777
– So how's it all going?
– I've finished that other wall.

159
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,377
Great.

160
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:23,097
And that architrave
ain't going to be a problem.

161
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:27,737
– And the eggshell's come up really well.
– Yeah, it's classy. It's really good.

162
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,217
Thank you for the cup of tea.

163
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:43,617
Oh, I should probably do that.

164
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,487
Dear Douglas,
if you're reading this,

165
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:54,297
– you've found my father's service revolver.
– Hell's horses!

166
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:57,417
I did plan on using this gun
to take my own life, if it came to it,

167
00:11:57,547 --> 00:12:00,897
but as you know,
in the end I jumped out of a window.

168
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:04,337
I pass it on to you in the hope
that if things ever get too bad,

169
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,537
you'll be able to take the easy way out.

170
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,377
Hopefully it won't come to it,
but if it does,

171
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:13,127
promise me that you'll shoot yourself
without a moment's hesitation.

172
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,217
I promise, Father.

173
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,697
Your affectionate father, Mr Reynholm.

174
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,657
I wonder if it's loaded.

175
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:27,937
No.

176
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,977
Here we go.

177
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,577
– You off somewhere?
– Yeah.

178
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,767
Yeah?

179
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:45,137
So, ...what's next on the agenda?

180
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,817
– Look, Jen, I know what's going on.
– You do?

181
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,977
And it's fine.
I understand, I really do.

182
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,407
So you understand how I feel.

183
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:57,577
Yeah, but you are barking up the wrong tree.

184
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:00,897
I mean, I think you're
a top bird and everything, but...

185
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:04,097
you're not really my type.

186
00:13:04,227 --> 00:13:09,167
I mean, I like tall... beautiful girls.

187
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:15,537
I don't fancy you,
you big, ugly builder.

188
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:22,467
I'm trying to stop you
having a piddle party in my house!

189
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:27,137
– What?
– Builders From Hell. Ring any bells?

190
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,257
– I don't know what you mean.
– You do.

191
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:33,167
– I don't.
– You haven't been on Builders From Hell?

192
00:13:33,307 --> 00:13:34,527
– No, I haven't.
– Really?!

193
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,857
– Yes, really.
– Really?!

194
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:38,017
Really!

195
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:43,807
Well... let's forget about it. Shall we?

196
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:47,737
This conversation's beneath us.

197
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:50,457
Wow, I love what you've done
to that wall, Gary.

198
00:13:50,587 --> 00:13:54,097
– I haven't done that wall yet.
– You haven't even done it, and I love it!

199
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:57,577
God, we should...
You and I should stay in touch.

200
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:00,297
I would like to stay in touch with you...

201
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:05,497
cos we've got a... a rapport,
haven't... haven't we?

202
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,577
We've clicked.
We have, we've clicked.

203
00:14:07,707 --> 00:14:09,537
Haven't we? In a way.

204
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:15,417
In a... in a... in a weird way
that friends... friends usually click.

205
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:23,337
"A big, ugly builder".

206
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,457
You. This is all because of you.

207
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,817
Jen, I didn't bring his weight into it!

208
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,137
You said you were 99% sure.

209
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:36,217
I don't think I ever went that high.

210
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:39,057
I've always thought it was about 60:40.

211
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:46,497
Now that I think about it, Jen, I'm pretty sure
that the guy on the programme was black.

212
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:52,177
Well, at least I don't have to worry about him
going on a toilet tour of my house.

213
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:56,257
Unless he's so angry
that he does it out of spite.

214
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:07,257
– What?
– If someone called me a "big, ugly builder",

215
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:11,257
I'd be furious – and not just because
I'm actually an IT consultant.

216
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:15,577
Revenge, that would be uppermost
upon my mind:

217
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,457
– "I'm going to wee on everything".
– Oh, God!

218
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,147
"I'm going to taint her abode".

219
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:24,857
"I'm going to strain my personal potatoes
throughout her premises. "

220
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,497
Oh, God!

221
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,967
– Nice glasses!
– Not as nice as your momma's glasses!

222
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:36,457
It's a little bit complimentary,
but we'll work on it.

223
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:41,327
I can't hang around the house –
he'll know I don't trust him.

224
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,457
But I can't leave him on his own.

225
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,737
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do, Roy?

226
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,657
Jen, just relax, OK?

227
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:53,097
I've often found that the best solution
is the simplest.

228
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:01,137
– Thanks again for doing this, Roy.
– No problem, Jen.

229
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:04,807
It's brilliantly easy
to spy on people these days.

230
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:08,377
– He won't see the cameras, will he?
– No, no.

231
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,657
They're pretty well hidden.

232
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,337
He's muttering a lot. Have you noticed?

233
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,337
"Fat, ugly builder"!

234
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,977
Take that, lollipop man!

235
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,007
Wow!

236
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:42,217
My grandfather's old service revolver.

237
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:47,457
To think of all the deserters
he shot in the head with this!

238
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,777
Are you ready?

239
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,627
– Ready for what?
– Japan!

240
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,377
Oh, is that meeting today?
Hell's bells!

241
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:59,537
You go ahead.
I'll be right there. I've just...

242
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,937
What was that?!

243
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,977
– What was what?
– That noise.

244
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,017
– What noise?
– The loud explosion!

245
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:10,497
Loud explosion?
What on earth are you talking about?!

246
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,657
– You didn't hear that just then?
– What are you talking about?

247
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:19,017
You come in here, ranting about gunshots
and service revolvers – I've had enough!

248
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:23,097
Get out! Go!
Go to the meeting. I'll be right there.

249
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:29,057
Hello. Does someone
have a problem with their laptop?

250
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:33,697
Now, you listen to me –
this is very important.

251
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:39,097
I have a vital meeting to attend,
and I've just shot myself in the leg.

252
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,527
Uh-huh?

253
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:44,647
I want you to dial 999.

254
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,297
No, it's a new number –
011...

255
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,857
Whatever the new number is...

256
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:54,137
get an ambulance and ask it to wait,

257
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:59,017
and I'll be there in two hours,
three hours tops.

258
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,617
Are you ready?

259
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:25,217
I was born... ready.

260
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:41,857
OK, Roy, we're on.
J'accuse! Gotcha!

261
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,977
OK, how do you record?
How do you record on this?

262
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,697
Roy?

263
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,697
Roy? Roy, how do you record?

264
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,297
OK... we're on.

265
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,337
Mr Yamamoto, hello.

266
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,227
He is angry!

267
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:40,687
Well, lots to think about there.
Thoughts, anyone?

268
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:44,577
No? We'll reconvene tomorrow.
Thank you, everyone.

269
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:47,217
But... but what did it all mean?

270
00:19:51,427 --> 00:19:54,817
– Mr Reynholm, are you all right?
– I'm fine, yes. Yes, I'm fine.

271
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:57,297
I'm going to go.

272
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,887
I may not come back.

273
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,257
But I want to say this:

274
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,617
that accounts team...

275
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,307
I had every last one of them.

276
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,817
Just a little bit further, son.

277
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:27,577
Father?! Is it really you?

278
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,577
– Is this really heaven?
– Yes, yes. Hurry up, come on.

279
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:34,377
I'm coming, Father.
I'm ready.

280
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,937
Whoa there!

281
00:20:37,067 --> 00:20:39,097
– Was that Hitler?
– Was what Hitler?

282
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:43,257
– That looked like Hitler.
– That wasn't Hitler, that was a woman.

283
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:46,217
Really?
Well, it looked exactly like Hitler.

284
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:49,657
We're having a heaven party,
and that's a Hitlergram.

285
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:53,187
Right, well,
I don't think I'm quite ready yet.

286
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:56,097
– Come on!
– No.

287
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,737
I'll see you later.
I've still got a lot of work to do.

288
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:03,217
– I'll see you later, Douglas.
– Not if I see you first.

289
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,607
...must call Mark Thatcher...

290
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,217
I'm alive!

291
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:18,497
Nolan!

292
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,577
My accounting team!

293
00:21:20,707 --> 00:21:23,897
And Roy... gentle, Irish Roy.

294
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:27,057
Thank you for being by my side
while I awake.

295
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:28,977
No problem, sir.

296
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:31,457
We don't want you going anywhere.

297
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:39,617
Isn't it lucky to see an Irishman when you
awake from a near–death experience?

298
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:43,367
I've heard that.
Even if it isn't, I appreciate it, Roy,

299
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:46,937
and I count myself lucky
to have you as a friend.

300
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:52,777
– He's exhausted. We should go.
– I'll stay with him, make sure he's OK.

301
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:07,377
Got you, you crafty Irish bastard!

302
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,537
I've got a gun!
I've got a ruddy gun!

303
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,177
I've got a flipping gun!
I've got a flipping gun!

304
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:18,817
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
I've got a mother-flipping gun!
