1
00:00:25,307 --> 00:00:26,947
"The IT Crowd": season 3, episode 2.

2
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:40,957
Is this your stapler, Roy?

3
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,707
No.

4
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:44,327
No, it's not.

5
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:45,677
I used it for one thing.

6
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:46,887
How many staples did you use?

7
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:48,087
Six or seven.

8
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:53,467
One, two, three, four...

9
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:55,387
five, six... Is that seven?

10
00:00:55,397 --> 00:00:57,007
Why do you need to know?

11
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:00,177
I just do.
I need to know, you know I need to know,

12
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,637
and you never count how
many staples you've used.

13
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,767
Eight, nine...
Gonna have to do it in fives.

14
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,977
Five, 10, 15... Is that 20?

15
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,397
There you go, Moss.

16
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:15,157
Awright, 'arry?
See that ludicrous display last night?

17
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,907
What was Wenger thinking,
sending Walcott on that early?

18
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:20,947
Fing about Arsenal is,
they always try an' walk it in.

19
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,117
True. See you later, Moss.

20
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,787
Mind 'ow you go.

21
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:29,037
What was that?

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,877
What?

23
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:33,007
You were saying football things,
in a football voice!

24
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:35,467
It's this new site.
It sends you a list

25
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:38,007
of football phrases that you
can use in normal conversation,

26
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:39,677
updated daily. It's great.

27
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:42,597
I only use it so I can say
something to the postman.

28
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,557
It's got a pronunciation
guide, or...

29
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,057
pronunciation guide.

30
00:01:51,977 --> 00:01:54,987
You can get it sent to your phone,
so that even when I'm away

31
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,157
from my desk I can still sound
like I'm just a big, normal man.

32
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,407
45, 50...

33
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,657
Hey, Moss,
send me a link for that, will you?

34
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,247
Right, I'm off.

35
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:04,907
Bit early!

36
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:05,957
Got a date.

37
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,457
Right, with Michael?

38
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,127
That's right.

39
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,537
Looks like a magician?

40
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,497
Yeah.

41
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,887
What?

42
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:19,587
What?

43
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,847
He looks like a what?

44
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,717
This is Michael, right?
The guy that came in last week?

45
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,427
He doesn't look
like a magician.

46
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,807
Yeah, he does.
He does, doesn't he, Moss?

47
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:31,517
The guy that came
in looking for Jen?

48
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,567
Michael the Magnificent.

49
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,607
He doesn't look
like a magician.

50
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:37,607
He does.

51
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,307
He doesn't.

52
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,987
He massively does.

53
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:41,117
He does, Jen.

54
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,197
Shut up.

55
00:02:52,457 --> 00:02:54,377
It's a lovely restaurant.

56
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:57,217
Isn't it?
One of my favourites, actually.

57
00:02:57,227 --> 00:03:00,797
One of the silly things I love about
this restaurant, have you had a look

58
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,717
at these salt and pepper pots,
they're really beautiful.

59
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,847
There's something about the shape,
and I'm probably a bit of

60
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:09,187
a design freak but it's
a kind of beautiful...

61
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,487
What are they saying that
could possibly be that funny?

62
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,617
I'm funny, why can't I be
over there making them laugh?

63
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:31,247
They're proper men, Roy.

64
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:33,037
We're men. We're proper men.

65
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,997
What's so different about us?

66
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,547
Seven, 14,

67
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:43,467
51, 35, 42,

68
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:47,887
49, 35...

69
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:48,807
Seven...

70
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,977
..21, 28...

71
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:19,967
Referee...

72
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,847
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

73
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:27,677
What's Wenger doing sending
Walcott on that early?

74
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:31,517
The thing about Arsenal is they
always try and walk it in.

75
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,397
Exactly. Dan.

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,397
Roy.

77
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,107
But Chelsea, on the other hand,
I like them suddenly.

78
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:40,737
Yeah.

79
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,997
Chelsea?
You're having a laugh int'ya?

80
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,337
I'll put money in
it if you like?

81
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,487
Nah, I've already got
a pony on Liverpool,

82
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,327
so I probably won't
see that again.

83
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:55,537
Dan, Moss. Moss, Dan.

84
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,587
Nice to meet you, son.
Want a drink, boys?

85
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,127
We'll get this.

86
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:01,377
Nah, it's on me.
Whatever these boys are having.

87
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:01,827
Here he is.

88
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,177
Roy, Moss, Derek, Luke. Moss here
fancies Liverpool for the weekend.

89
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:12,017
Liverpool? You're
having a laugh int'ya?

90
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:13,227
He's put a pony on it!

91
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:14,057
A pony?

92
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,647
Yeah, I know. Tell Barry!

93
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:16,977
Tell me what?

94
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,477
He's only put a
pony on Liverpool.

95
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,437
You lunatic?

96
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,267
So, who do you support?

97
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:57,647
Who do I support?

98
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,107
Yeah.

99
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:03,147
West Ham.

100
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:08,317
Did you say West Ham?

101
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,197
Is that all right?

102
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,237
All right?

103
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,697
What does that look like?
A birthmark?

104
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:19,957
Look on his face!

105
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:22,497
Look on my face!

106
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,377
Roy, can I have a natter with you?

107
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,927
It's about private man's business.
I'm sure you boys will understand.

108
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,637
Excuse me, please.

109
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,347
I'm a little bit scared,
and I want to leave.

110
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:38,897
What?

111
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:42,017
We're in too deep, Roy.
I'm worried they're going to find out

112
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,067
I don't know what a pony is.
We should go.

113
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:46,397
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't paid for a drink

114
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,737
all night, and besides, once you
get over the whole football thing,

115
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,157
they're actually surprisingly
easy to talk to.

116
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,787
Maybe we're proper men!

117
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,327
Look, we're messing with
stuff we don't understand.

118
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,997
We're through the
looking glass.

119
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,287
Just promise me you will
not let this get too far.

120
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,037
I promise.

121
00:07:09,717 --> 00:07:12,297
Hooray. He's kicked the ball.

122
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,137
Now the ball's over there.

123
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,807
That man has it now.

124
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,387
That's an
interesting development.

125
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,607
Maybe he'll kick the ball.

126
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:25,817
He has indeed and apparently that
deserves a round of applause.

127
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:27,277
Will you shut up!

128
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:28,817
This is the worst
thing in the world.

129
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:29,907
What could I do?

130
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,527
He bought the tickets on the
phone when we were in the pub.

131
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,027
I could hardly say no, could I?

132
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,197
Can I use this?

133
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,697
I don't know.

134
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:45,047
They're singing!
Maybe we should!

135
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,757
Just promise me we won't do
anything else with them,

136
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,587
I want to go back
to being weird.

137
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:53,297
I like being weird, weird's all
I've got. That and my sweet style.

138
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,467
OK, look here, we'll make our
excuses when the match is over.

139
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:58,307
How long do football
matches last?

140
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,437
A billion hours apparently.

141
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,397
Gonna play poker tonight,
you game?

142
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,397
I'm in.

143
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,227
Moss?

144
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,567
I won't Dan, no.

145
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,187
Come on.

146
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,567
No, no can do.
I'm seein' a bird.

147
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,817
Really?

148
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:13,447
Yeah, why not.

149
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:14,697
What's she like?

150
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:18,327
Well, she's not much to look
at but she is very kind 'arted.

151
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,827
So as I say,
I've gotta vamoosh.

152
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:22,367
What, you're not watching it?

153
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,827
They're 'aving a larf today.

154
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,877
We're winning.

155
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,497
No, they're having a larf.

156
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,847
Morning.

157
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:46,727
My word. When did the
English start drinking like that?

158
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,027
You people drink like
you don't want to live.

159
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,987
We do love to binge.

160
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,357
What happened to you?

161
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,067
I've got Cockney neck,

162
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:57,697
I've been speaking too much Cockney
and it's done my blooming neck in.

163
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,617
Here she is.

164
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,997
Debbie McGee.

165
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,787
Morning, all.
I'm off to break up with him.

166
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,747
What's wrong with you two?

167
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,527
We've been hanging
out with men.

168
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:11,887
Why are you breaking
up with him?

169
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,377
Why? What do you mean why?

170
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,797
Because he looks
like a magician.

171
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:16,927
Doesn't he, though?

172
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:18,557
He totally does.

173
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:21,017
And ever since you two said
it I haven't been able

174
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,347
to get it out of my head.
So thanks, thanks a lot.

175
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,017
Another one bites the dust.

176
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,807
You're not breaking
up cos of that?!

177
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,527
I can't be seen
with that... mentalist.

178
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,357
Do you know what he
does for a living?

179
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,647
He is a driving instructor.

180
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:40,117
A driving instructor who looks like
a magician. It's preposterous.

181
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,787
That's almost the worst look a
driving instructor could have.

182
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,407
So distracting.

183
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,167
Only clown would be worse.

184
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:48,917
Or mountie.

185
00:09:51,377 --> 00:09:54,087
So, how was your night
of poker with the boys?

186
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:55,927
Yeah, good, good.

187
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:58,927
I mean, I didn't...
I wasn't brilliant at the start because,

188
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:00,557
you know,
I was mostly vomiting.

189
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,717
Lovely.

190
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:06,097
But then I knuckled down and
I brought my "A" game and,

191
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,767
things got a lot better.

192
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,307
That's good,
how much did you win?

193
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,397
No, no, I lost £200.
But it's less than I usually lose, so...

194
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,397
Still, £200 though.

195
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,157
Mm, but listen to this,
Dan let me off.

196
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,077
He just totally let me off.
Proper men are so cool.

197
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,037
They just don't
care about money.

198
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,287
Hello.

199
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:30,167
Where's my fackin' money?

200
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:31,957
I want that money,
give me my money.

201
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,877
Really?

202
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:36,507
I'm only joking,
you muppet. Ha-ha!

203
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:40,427
You're funny.

204
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,507
'Oi, listen,'

205
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,977
a friend of mine's let me down.
Can you meet me at lunch?

206
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,687
Yeah, OK, OK.

207
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,477
I just went to the toilet.

208
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:49,937
What's your address?

209
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,007
Here he is. Hiya, Dan.

210
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:06,757
You got here.

211
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,047
Oi-oi, boys.

212
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,547
All right, mate.
All right? You all right?

213
00:11:10,557 --> 00:11:12,557
Yeah, pretty good.

214
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,787
Hey,
sorry again about last night.

215
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,397
Nah, don't mention it.
Listen, that favour,

216
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:19,137
you wouldn't be available to do
a little taxi job would you?

217
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,647
You want me to drive?

218
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:22,307
This?

219
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,977
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

220
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,897
I wouldn't bother you with this,
but someone's let me down.

221
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,447
It should only take
a couple of hours.

222
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,867
It's no problem.
Is it an automatic?

223
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,777
Cos I can only drive an automatic.
It is an automatic.

224
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:38,177
I'm your man. And you're sure
that everything with the money is OK?

225
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:40,247
Yeah, yeah.
This makes us totally quits.

226
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:43,207
You, sir, are a gentlemen.

227
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,047
This guy?

228
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:57,427
Here we go.
Pull over here, Roy.

229
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,847
OK.

230
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,647
"You have reached
your destination."

231
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,227
All right, everyone.

232
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:09,567
Take your time.

233
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,817
Yey,
how do you get the radio to work?

234
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,617
I've got it, got it.

235
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:18,577
I love this one.

236
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:29,097
– Yeah?
– Hey, man. All right?

237
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,727
Hey, do you want to
meet up after this?

238
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,087
Yeah, nothing's happening here.

239
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:38,427
The guys have this lockup down
by the gas works on Newcombe Road.

240
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:42,687
The gas works? Is there anything
about them that's not manly?

241
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,107
Jesus! Moss!

242
00:12:45,117 --> 00:12:46,437
Jesus Christ!

243
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,757
What? What is it?

244
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,487
There's a robbery!

245
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:51,197
Across the road, right here.

246
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:55,817
There's a robbery.
There's some blokes in balaclavas.

247
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,367
Wow! They're,
they're totally robbing this place.

248
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,867
Call the police,
call the police.

249
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,827
Yeah, bye.

250
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:08,627
Police, please.

251
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:12,757
Yeah, hi, I'm on Denbury
Road and there is a robbery

252
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,757
taking place right now.

253
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:19,637
Three men, indiscriminate race,
balaclavas, big guns.

254
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,727
Yeah, OK...

255
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:23,767
My God, they're coming out.

256
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:26,227
They're coming out,
OK, they're coming out.

257
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:29,357
They're running towards us.
They're running towards the car.

258
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,647
They're getting...

259
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,897
DRIVE!

260
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:35,357
Okey-dokey.

261
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,207
Straight ahead. OK.

262
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,997
Yeah, go on, keep going, mate.

263
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:52,257
Right, swing a left here.

264
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:55,217
Right, drive up
those ramps there.

265
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:57,847
Right, drive up the
ramps into the truck.

266
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:58,797
Come on, Roy, quickly!

267
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,307
Yep, okey-doke.

268
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:05,097
Come on!

269
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,937
I'm climbing onto the truck.
Am I on it? Am I on it? I can't see.

270
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,937
No!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

271
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:13,487
What's the matter with you?

272
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,647
Get driving, man!

273
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:16,987
Just get it up!

274
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:24,787
Up, up, up,
up we go into the truck.

275
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,147
What's that? Is someone crying?

276
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,567
No.

277
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:59,817
Did you see that ludicrous
display last night?

278
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:07,287
What was Wenger thinking
bringing Walcott on that early?

279
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:17,417
The thing about Arsenal is,
they always try and walk it in.

280
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,177
But why? I don't understand,

281
00:15:25,187 --> 00:15:27,637
I thought it was going so well.
Was it something I did?

282
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,897
No, no. It's hard to explain.

283
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:34,357
Tell me, Jen, for God's sake.
You owe me that much.

284
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,277
You look like a
magician, Michael.

285
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:40,987
All right?

286
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:45,027
I'm sorry, but you do.
I didn't notice at first,

287
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:48,327
but then someone mentioned it
and now I can't get it out of my head.

288
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,827
But I'm not a magician.

289
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:52,627
I know, that's why it's not
good that you look like one.

290
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,207
Well, what is it,
exactly, about me?

291
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:59,217
It's everything.

292
00:15:59,227 --> 00:16:02,597
There's nothing about you that
doesn't look like a magician.

293
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:06,467
It's everything. Don't you see it?
Don't you wake up every morning

294
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:09,597
and look in the mirror and think,
"Christ, I look like a magician!"?

295
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:12,517
No. Well, you should.

296
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:16,567
I would, if I was a weirdy,
beardy magiciany man.

297
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:19,027
I'm just trying to
help you, Michael.

298
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:21,697
So it's over because of that?

299
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:24,617
I don't see any way past it.

300
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:27,367
It's weird, it's weird for me.

301
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,697
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:32,747
No, wait.
Maybe we can think of something.

303
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:40,217
What if I actually
learned some magic tricks?

304
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:43,087
– What do you mean?
– Perhaps if I learned some tricks,

305
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:47,347
it wouldn't feel so strange
that I look like a magician.

306
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:50,137
You'd have to learn
a lot of tricks.

307
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:55,437
I mean, you'd basically you'd have
to actually become a magician.

308
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,437
Do you really want to make
that kind of commitment?

309
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,777
What was all that about?

310
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,817
We was stitched up,
they knew we were there.

311
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:06,607
Shut up, Barry.

312
00:17:06,617 --> 00:17:08,917
It was always a possibility,
that's why we had the truck.

313
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:12,867
We were barely out of there before the
bill turned up. Someone grassed us up.

314
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:14,497
Is that the...?

315
00:17:14,507 --> 00:17:17,497
I've got to go,
I don't want to miss Gok's Fashion Fix.

316
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,327
Yeah, you're too
quick to trust people.

317
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,977
What do we know about this bloke?
How do we know he didn't do it?

318
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:25,007
Because he didn't know about
it till this afternoon.

319
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:26,967
I didn't know about it
till this afternoon.

320
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:29,597
That's why I chose him to
do it after you shot Derek.

321
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,767
That's why he chose me to
do it after you shot Derek.

322
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:35,307
Hello.

323
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,397
Hiya.

324
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,607
You remember Moss?

325
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:43,197
So, tell me all about
the big robbery.

326
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,947
What?

327
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:47,527
Roy saw a robbery.

328
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:50,367
Did you phone the police
like you said you would?

329
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:54,497
I didn't say that,
I said I was listening to The Police.

330
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,377
Look at all that money.
I wonder how much is there?

331
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,497
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

332
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:03,967
You and your bloody great ideas.
I mean, who's this bloke?

333
00:18:03,977 --> 00:18:07,337
All we know about him is
he supports West Ham.

334
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,347
Or maybe that's a lie too.

335
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:12,267
Hey, hey now, little man.

336
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:16,767
You can stand there and
slag me off all you like.

337
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:20,857
But don't you start talking about
how I feel about my beloved West Ham.

338
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,437
Cos I love 'em.

339
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,397
I love 'em gooners.

340
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,407
That's bloody Arsenal.

341
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:29,827
Look, if you've got a problem with him,
you've got a problem with me.

342
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:31,407
You're fucking right I have!

343
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:33,697
Excuse me,
I am trying to concentrate over here.

344
00:18:33,707 --> 00:18:38,077
And will you watch your ruddy language?
My ears are not a toilet.

345
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,707
Derek was right about you.

346
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,427
What are you after?
My piece of the action?

347
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:43,297
You want to end up in
the boot with Derek, son?

348
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:44,717
Do you want to make one?

349
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,907
Yeah, I'll make one, mate.
I'll make one right now.

350
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,877
Yeah? Let's have it.
Don't you mug yourself.

351
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,467
Let's have it!
Don't mug yourself!

352
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,937
I need to know
how much is there.

353
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:03,527
No, you don't.

354
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:07,397
We need to get out of here, OK?
We do not want to get mixed up in this.

355
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:11,947
What are we going
to do now? Quick.

356
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,287
Get out of the way,
you bloody poof.

357
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,507
OK, let's go.

358
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,627
Couldn't we have just have
hidden behind those bins?

359
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,807
I suppose.

360
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,537
Right, let's go.

361
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:15,597
So, if you just place
these back into the pack.

362
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:18,427
Just pop it back in, that's it.
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

363
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:24,147
And before your very eyes,
I shall do the magic shuffle.

364
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,227
And, — ignore that —
this will go in here

365
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:31,567
and Bob's your uncle,
abracadabra, is this your card?

366
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:35,987
No, Michael.

367
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:38,037
I'm sorry, Michael,

368
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,117
it's over.

369
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,917
I better make sure
she's all right.

370
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:49,967
Anyone see the final
last night?

371
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:51,377
Fuck off, Harry.

372
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:03,597
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300,

373
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:07,897
350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600...

374
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:18,947
I think my dentist lives near here,
do you know him?

375
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:22,037
That's a stupid question —
why would you know him?

376
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,247
It's not like you
live in the truck.

377
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:29,257
So, what sort of truck is this?
Are there different sorts of trucks?

378
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,917
Is that a stupid question?

379
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:34,637
Listen to me chatting away
like Stephen bloody Fry.

380
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,347
Who closed the door?

381
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,347
